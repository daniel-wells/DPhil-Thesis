Meiosis is a specialised cell division producing haploid gametes required for sexual reproduction.

A key function of this process is to generate genetically diverse gametes through recombination and independent assortment of homologous chromosomes.

The mechanisms of meiosis have important implications in the fertility, speciation, and evolution of all sexually reproducing organisms.

% One sentence stating the general problem

Delineation of meiotic gene expression has been a challenge due to the heterogeneity of testis tissue  and that the meiotic programme can not be reconstructed in a synchronous manner in vitro.

Here we use single cell RNA sequencing and matrix decomposition methods to elucidate the sequence of gene expression during the meiotic programme.
