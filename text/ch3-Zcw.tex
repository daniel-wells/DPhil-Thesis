\section{Introduction}


Another candidate gene is Zcwpw1, which ranks 3rd after Prdm9. Although this gene does not have a known function, it contains two protein domains: CW and PWWP, which are known to bind H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 respectively \cite{He2010-by, Rona2016-fj}. The events linking Prdm9 binding to recombination initiation by Spo11 are currently unclear. However, Prdm9 deposits both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at sites it binds \cite{Powers2016-fs}, and this methyltransferase activity is essential for its role in double strand break positioning \cite{Diagouraga2018-ty}, suggesting these marks may be recognized by downstream protein(s). We therefore hypothesise that Zcwpw1 might co-localise to recombination hotspots, by binding the histone modifications deposited by Prdm9. Further work will be required to test this, and the potential role of Zcwpw1 in meiotic recombination.
