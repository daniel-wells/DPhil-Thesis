  abstract = {The study of crossing-over leads us on the one hand to consideration of the physio-chemical nature and behaviour of the chromosomes, and, on the other to conclusions respecting the better-known phenomena of segregation, pairing, recombination and gene action. Although many aspects of the cause and consequence of crossing–over are still not fully analysed, important conclusions have already been reached. The chiasmatype theory, that crossing–over is the sole condition of chiasma formation, allows of the accurate co-ordination of the genetical and cytological methods of study of crossing–over. The genetical method consists of marking alternative chromosomes by the use of gene allelomorphs, the segregation and recombination of which may be followed. The cytological method is that of direct observation. The two methods are complementary in their natures. Crossing–over occurs when the pachytene chromosomes divide and tends to occur in definite positions in the chromosome, as a result of a special time and spacial sequence in formation. The positions are related to fixed points, viz. the centromeres and, possibly, the ends of the chromosomes. The movements of the chromosomes in crossing–over are related to coiling although the generation and distribution of the energy are not fully understood. Pachytene pairing is directionally specific, i.e. the chromomeres or pairing units are asymmetrical in type. The chromosomes show definite longitudinal cohesion and can transmit stresses along their length. Splitting of the chromosomes generates or releases such stresses, which may be transmitted and partially accommodated in unsplit regions. The unaccommodated stresses result in crossing–over. The frequency of recombination of loci is related algebraically to the frequency of crossing–over between them by the alternate terms of a binomial expansion. The relation may be expressed empirically in a logarithmic form. In the absence of chromatid interference recombination cannot exceed 50 per cent. Chromatid interference may result in a slight increase of this level. The frequency of reductional and equational separation of a locus depends on the behaviour at the centromere and on the frequency of crossing–over between the locus and the centromere. The relation is of the form of a summed geometrical series. Segregation in aberrant diploid and in autopolyploid types depends on the frequency of these types of separation. Although the limiting value of recombination may be reached when the loci concerned are but little more than 50 map units apart, they may still show correlated separation. Metaphase pairing and anaphase disjunction of the meiotic chromosomes is dependent, in the vast majority of cases, on chiasma formation. The regular occurrence of crossing–over is almost universally necessary for full fertility. In cases where the sexes differ in the manner of meiotic pairing, notably Drosophila, there is a corresponding variation in segregation, recombination, and disjunction. The presumably widespread occurrence of primary structural change, mainly duplication and inversion, leads to the regular occurrence of variant types by crossing–over. These, as in Oenothera and Drosophila, often have distinctive physiological characteristics and so are a source of material for the action of natural selection. The frequency of crossing–over per bivalent is open to selective action, and probably reaches an optimum value in any organism. This will chiefly result from its effects on the recombination of advantageous mutants.},

  abstract = {Genetic recombination occurs during meiosis, the key developmental programme of gametogenesis. Recombination in mammals has been recently linked to the activity of a histone H3 methyltransferase, PR domain containing 9 (PRDM9)1,2,3,4,5,6, the product of the only known speciation-associated gene in mammals7. PRDM9 is thought to determine the preferred recombination sites—recombination hotspots—through sequence-specific binding of its highly polymorphic multi-Zn-finger domain8. Nevertheless, Prdm9 knockout mice are proficient at initiating recombination9. Here we map and analyse the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in Prdm9 knockout mice and in two mouse strains with different Prdm9 alleles and their F1 hybrid. We show that PRDM9 determines the positions of practically all hotspots in the mouse genome, with the exception of the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR)—the only area of the genome that undergoes recombination in 100\% of cells10. Surprisingly, hotspots are still observed in Prdm9 knockout mice, and as in wild type, these hotspots are found at H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation marks. However, in the absence of PRDM9, most recombination is initiated at promoters and at other sites of PRDM9-independent H3K4 trimethylation. Such sites are rarely targeted in wild-type mice, indicating an unexpected role of the PRDM9 protein in sequestering the recombination machinery away from gene-promoter regions and other functional genomic elements.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe “X-Y crossover model” described in this paper postulates that (1) the pairing observed between the X and the Y chromosome at zygotene is a consequence of genetic homology, (2) there is a single obligatory crossover between the X and Y pairing segments, and (3) the segment of the X which pairs with the Y is protected from subsequent X inactivation. Genes distal to the proposed crossover (“pseudoautosomal genes”) will appear to be autosomally inherited because they will be transmitted to both male and female offspring. Some criteria for identifying pseudoautosomal genes are outlined.The existence of a single obligatory crossover between the X and Y of the mouse is strongly supported by a recent demonstration that the sex-reversing mutation Sxr, which is passed equally to XX and XY offspring by male carriers, is transmitted on the sex chromosomes. Pseudoautosomally inherited genes may also be responsible for XX sex reversal in goats and familial XX sex reversal in man.},

  abstract = {Accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis requires physical links between homologs. These links are usually established through chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination, which occur during meiotic prophase. How chromosomes pair with their homologous partners is one of the outstanding mysteries of meiosis. Surprisingly, experimental evidence indicates that different organisms have found more than one way to accomplish this feat. Whereas some species depend on recombination machinery to achieve homologous pairing, others are able to pair and synapse their homologs in the absence of recombination. To ensure specific pairing between homologous chromosomes, both recombination-dependent and recombination-independent mechanisms must strike the proper balance between forces that promote chromosome interactions and activities that temper the promiscuity of those interactions. The initiation of synapsis is likely to be a tightly regulated step in a process that must be mechanically coupled to homolog pairing.},

  abstract = {In meiosis, homologous chromosomes face the obstacle of finding, holding onto and segregating away from their partner chromosome. There is increasing evidence, in a diverse range of organisms, that centromere–centromere interactions that occur in late prophase are an important mechanism in ensuring segregation fidelity. Centromere pairing appears to initiate when homologous chromosomes synapse in meiotic prophase. Structural proteins of the synaptonemal complex have been shown to help mediate centromere pairing, but how the structure that maintains centromere pairing differs from the structure of the synaptonemal complex along the chromosomal arms remains unknown. When the synaptonemal complex proteins disassemble from the chromosome arms in late prophase, some of these synaptonemal complex components persist at the centromeres. In yeast and Drosophila these centromere-pairing behaviors promote the proper segregation of chromosome partners that have failed to become linked by chiasmata. Recent studies of mouse spermatocytes have described centromere pairing behaviors that are similar in several respects to what has been described in the fly and yeast systems. In humans, chromosomes that fail to experience crossovers in meiosis are error-prone and are a major source of aneuploidy. The finding that centromere pairing is a conserved phenomenon raises the possibility that it may play a role in promoting the segregation fidelity of non-exchange chromosome pairs in humans.},

  abstract = {In mitotically dividing cells, the cohesin complex tethers sister chromatids, the products of DNA replication, together from the time they are generated during S phase until anaphase. Cohesion between sister chromatids ensures accurate chromosome segregation, and promotes normal gene regulation and certain kinds of DNA repair. In somatic cells, the core cohesin complex is composed of four subunits: Smc1, Smc3, Rad21 and an SA subunit. During meiotic cell divisions meiosis-specific isoforms of several of the cohesin subunits are also expressed and incorporated into distinct meiotic cohesin complexes. The relative contributions of these meiosis-specific forms of cohesin to chromosome dynamics during meiotic progression have not been fully worked out. However, the localization of these proteins during chromosome pairing and synapsis, and their unique loss-of-function phenotypes, suggest non-overlapping roles in controlling meiotic chromosome behavior. Many of the proteins that regulate cohesin function during mitosis also appear to regulate cohesin during meiosis. Here we review how cohesin contributes to meiotic chromosome dynamics, and explore similarities and differences between cohesin regulation during the mitotic cell cycle and meiotic progression. A deeper understanding of the regulation and function of cohesin in meiosis will provide important new insights into how the cohesin complex is able to promote distinct kinds of chromosome interactions under diverse conditions.},

We applied a combination of lectin histochemistry for acrosomes and immunohistochemistry for various specific cell markers, both of which were visualized with fluorescence, on paraffin sections of the testis. We first examined seminiferous tubules from normal mice and counted the number of each cell type at each stage of spermatogenesis. We then examined seminiferous tubules from genetically modified mice deficient (-/-) for one of the cell adhesion molecules, nectin-2 or nectin-3, and compared the number of each cell type at each stage of spermatogenesis with the corresponding value in normal mice. In both nectin-2-/- and nectin-3-/- mice, which are infertile despite the apparently normal morphology of the seminiferous epithelia, we measured a progressive loss in the later-step spermatids, with significantly lower numbers of step 11–16 spermatids in nectin-3-/- mice and step 15–16 spermatids in nectin-2-/- mice as compared with that in normal control mice. The present study demonstrated that a quantitative analysis of cellular compositions at different stages in seminiferous tubules was useful for evaluating abnormalities in spermatogenesis.},

The total number of Sertoli cells establishes the upper limit of sperm production by the testis, and spermatogenic efficiency is highly correlated with Sertoli cell support capacity, which is the best indication of Sertoli cell function. Sertoli cell individual volume shows high variation in mammals, varying from approximately 2000–3000 μm3 to 6000–7000 μm3 in mammals already investigated. However, it is generally recognized that species in which Sertoli cell volume is high are those with the lowest spermatogenic efficiency. The volume density of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium also changes considerably in mammals and the mean figures range from approximately 15\% in mice and rabbit. One of the first features of the Sertoli cell is the unique appearance of the nucleus and its tripartite nucleolus. The Sertoli cell nucleus is large (250–850 μm3) and can take on several different shapes depending on the stage of the seminiferous cycle and age of development. From birth to adulthood, the nucleus is often elongated, extending toward the lumen, but there are definite changes in appearance as the testis matures. The early support cells of the seminiferous tubule are often called pre-Sertoli cells because the nuclear appearance differs from the adult form, yet in some species the pre-Sertoli cells still have the typical nuclear features of irregular shape and a prominent nucleolus.},

Biochemistry and molecular biology then changed all of biological sciences, including our understanding of the functions of Sertoli cells. Immunology and stem cell biology were not even topics of science in 1865, but they have now become major issues in our appreciation of Sertoli cell's role in spermatogenesis. We end with the universal importance and plasticity of function by comparing Sertoli cells in fish, amphibians, and mammals. In these various classes of vertebrates, Sertoli cells have quite different modes of proliferation and epithelial maintenance, cystic vs. tubular formation, yet accomplish essentially the same function but in strikingly different ways.},

  abstract = {The meiosis-specific chromosomal events of homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination occur over an extended meiotic prophase I that is many times longer than prophase of mitosis. Here we show that, in mice, maintenance of an extended meiotic prophase I requires the gene Meioc, a germ-cell specific factor conserved in most metazoans. In mice, Meioc is expressed in male and female germ cells upon initiation of and throughout meiotic prophase I. Mouse germ cells lacking Meioc initiate meiosis: they undergo pre-meiotic DNA replication, they express proteins involved in synapsis and recombination, and a subset of cells progress as far as the zygotene stage of prophase I. However, cells in early meiotic prophase-as early as the preleptotene stage-proceed to condense their chromosomes and assemble a spindle, as if having progressed to metaphase. Meioc-deficient spermatocytes that have initiated synapsis mis-express CYCLIN A2, which is normally expressed in mitotic spermatogonia, suggesting a failure to properly transition to a meiotic cell cycle program. MEIOC interacts with YTHDC2, and the two proteins pull-down an overlapping set of mitosis-associated transcripts. We conclude that when the meiotic chromosomal program is initiated, Meioc is simultaneously induced so as to extend meiotic prophase. Specifically, MEIOC, together with YTHDC2, promotes a meiotic (as opposed to mitotic) cell cycle program via post-transcriptional control of their target transcripts.},

As a consequence, the development and/or application of methodological approaches aiming at the enrichment or purification of specific testicular cell types are of great interest and have been addressed by scientists for at least 4 decades. Among the many applications that flow cytometry (FC) has gained since its invention, analysis and sorting of spermatogenic cell populations represent a promising strategy to efficiently overcome testis heterogeneity drawback. Surprisingly, FC has been only rarely used as a preparative method for downstream gene expression studies in specific spermatogenic stages. This work aims to provide an overview of FC for spermatogenic studies including preparation of testicular single cell suspensions, dyes for DNA staining, and our own experience with rodent testis material.},

Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell's expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here we illustrate and enhance the use of matrix factorization as a solution to this problem. We show with simulations that a method that we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including the relative contribution of programs in each cell. Applied to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets, cNMF refines the hierarchy of cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and intriguing novel activity programs. We propose that one of the novel programs may reflect a neurosecretory phenotype and a second may underlie the formation of neuronal synapses. We make cNMF available to the community and illustrate how this approach can provide key insights into gene expression variation within and between cell types.},

  abstract = {In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination. PRDM9 binds to DNA at hotspots through its zinc finger domain and activates recombination by trimethylating histone H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes through its PR/SET domain. Recently, the isolated PR/SET domain of PRDM9 was shown capable of also trimethylating H3K36 in vitro, raising the question of whether this reaction occurs in vivo during meiosis, and if so, what its function might be. Here, we show that full-length PRDM9 does trimethylate H3K36 in vivo in mouse spermatocytes. Levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are highly correlated at hotspots, but mutually exclusive elsewhere. In vitro, we find that although PRDM9 trimethylates H3K36 much more slowly than it does H3K4, PRDM9 is capable of placing both marks on the same histone molecules. In accord with these results, we also show that PRDM9 can trimethylate both K4 and K36 on the same nucleosomes in vivo, but the ratio of K4me3/K36me3 is much higher for the pair of nucleosomes adjacent to the PRDM9 binding site compared to the next pair further away. Importantly, H3K4me3/H3K36me3-double-positive nucleosomes occur only in regions of recombination: hotspots and the pseudoautosomal (PAR) region of the sex chromosomes. These double-positive nucleosomes are dramatically reduced when PRDM9 is absent, showing that this signature is PRDM9-dependent at hotspots; the residual double-positive nucleosomes most likely come from the PRDM9-independent PAR. These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process. Given the known requirement of H3K36me3 for double strand break repair by homologous recombination in somatic cells, we suggest that it may play the same role in meiosis.},

The spermatophages develop from precursor cells which invade the seminiferous tubules. After phagocytosis of spermatozoa they increase in size and sometimes possess more than one nucleus. Large spherically shaped spermatophages are found in the epididymis. In the rete spaces of Macaca fascicularis spermatophages are able to penetrate the rete epithelia and reside in the subepithelial connective tissue layers. Spermatophagy is frequently seen in the gonads of older men and in certain cases of oligozoospermia. In Macaca an increased number of spermatophages occurs at the end of the spermatogenetic season.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During meiosis, the X and Y chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced. The persistence of repressive chromatin marks on the sex chromatin after meiosis initially led to the assumption that XY gene silencing persists to some extent in spermatids. Considering the many reports of XY-linked genes expressed and needed in the post-meiotic phase of mouse spermatogenesis, it is still unclear whether or not the mouse sex chromatin is a repressive or permissive environment, after meiosis. RESULTS: To determine the transcriptional and chromatin state of the sex chromosomes after meiosis, we re-analyzed ten ChIP-Seq datasets performed on mouse round spermatids and four RNA-seq datasets from male germ cells purified at different stages of spermatogenesis. For this, we used the last version of the genome (mm10/GRCm38) and included reads that map to several genomic locations in order to properly interpret the high proportion of sex chromosome-encoded multicopy genes. Our study shows that coverage of active epigenetic marks H3K4me3 and Kcr is similar on the sex chromosomes and on autosomes. The post-meiotic sex chromatin nevertheless differs from autosomal chromatin in its enrichment in H3K9me3 and its depletion in H3K27me3 and H4 acetylation. We also identified a posttranslational modification, H3K27ac, which specifically accumulates on the Y chromosome. In parallel, we found that the X and Y chromosomes are enriched in genes expressed post-meiotically and display a higher proportion of spermatid-specific genes compared to autosomes. Finally, we observed that portions of chromosome 14 and of the sex chromosomes share specific features, such as enrichment in H3K9me3 and the presence of multicopy genes that are specifically expressed in round spermatids, suggesting that parts of chromosome 14 are under the same evolutionary constraints than the sex chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our expression and epigenomic studies, we conclude that, after meiosis, the mouse sex chromosomes are no longer silenced but are nevertheless regulated differently than autosomes and accumulate different chromatin marks. We propose that post-meiotic selective constraints are at the basis of the enrichment of spermatid-specific genes and of the peculiar chromatin composition of the sex chromosomes and of parts of chromosome 14.},

Within a given cross section of a seminiferous tubule, multiple germ and somatic cell types co-occur.

To address this challenge, we collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from ∼35,000 cells from the adult mouse testis and identified all known germ and somatic cells, as well as two unexpected somatic cell types. Our analysis revealed a continuous developmental trajectory of germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids and identified candidate transcriptional regulators at several transition points during differentiation. Focused analyses delineated four subtypes of spermatogonia and nine subtypes of Sertoli cells; the latter linked to histologically defined developmental stages over the seminiferous epithelial cycle. Overall, this high-resolution cellular atlas represents a community resource and foundation of knowledge to study germ cell development and in vivo gametogenesis.},

We determined the global effect of CREM on spermatogenesis as well as distinguished between primary and secondary effects of the CREM absence. We demonstrated that the absence of Crem deregulates over 4700 genes in KO testis. Among them are 101 genes associated with spermatogenesis 41 of which are bound by CREM and are deregulated in Crem KO testis. Absence of several of these genes in mouse models has proven their importance for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility. Our study showed that the absence of Crem plays a more important role on different aspects of spermatogenesis as estimated previously, with its impact ranging from apoptosis induction to deregulation of major circadian clock genes, steroidogenesis and the cell-cell junction dynamics. Several new genes important for normal spermatogenesis and fertility are down-regulated in KO testis and are therefore possible novel targets of CREM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The male germline transcriptome changes dramatically during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition to activate late spermatogenesis genes and to transiently suppress genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis progenitor cells, termed somatic/progenitor genes. RESULTS: These changes reflect epigenetic regulation. Induction of late spermatogenesis genes during spermatogenesis is facilitated by poised chromatin established in the stem cell phases of spermatogonia, whereas silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during meiosis and postmeiosis is associated with formation of bivalent domains which also allows the recovery of the somatic/progenitor program after fertilization. Importantly, during spermatogenesis mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on sex chromosomes are different from autosomes: X-linked somatic/progenitor genes are suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation without deposition of H3K27me3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me2/3 domains are not limited to developmental promoters (which maintain bivalent domains that are silent throughout the reproductive cycle), but also underlie reversible silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in late spermatogenesis.},

However, the protein factors mediating meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and the requirement of this attachment for homolog pairing and synapsis have not been determined in animals. Here we show that the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN1 specifically associates with telomeres between the leptotene and diplotene stages during meiotic prophase I. Disruption of Sun1 in mice prevents telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, efficient homolog pairing, and synapsis formation in meiosis. Massive apoptotic events are induced in the mutant gonads, leading to the abolishment of both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This study provides genetic evidence that SUN1-telomere interaction is essential for telomere dynamic movement and is required for efficient homologous chromosome pairing/synapsis during mammalian gametogenesis.},

However, the mechanisms governing this initiation of meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined cells undergoing meiotic initiation in mice, and we found that initiation involves the dramatic upregulation of a transcriptional network of thousands of genes whose expression is not limited to meiosis. This broad gene expression program is directly upregulated by STRA8, encoded by a germ cell-specific gene required for meiotic initiation. STRA8 binds its own promoter and those of thousands of other genes, including meiotic prophase genes, factors mediating DNA replication and the G1-S cell-cycle transition, and genes that promote the lengthy prophase unique to meiosis I. We conclude that, in mice, the robust amplification of this extraordinarily broad transcription program by a common factor triggers initiation of meiosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Life-long production of spermatozoa depends on spermatogonial stem cells. Spermatogonial stem cells exist among the most primitive population of germ cells - undifferentiated spermatogonia. Transplantation experiments have demonstrated the functional heterogeneity of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Although the undifferentiated spermatogonia can be topographically divided into As (single), Apr (paired), and Aal (aligned) spermatogonia, subdivision of this primitive cell population using cytological markers would greatly facilitate characterization of their functions. RESULTS: In the present study, we show that LIN28, a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia (As, Apr, and Aal) in mouse. Ngn3 also specifically labels undifferentiated spermatogonia. We used Ngn3-GFP knockin mice, in which GFP expression is under the control of all Ngn3 transcription regulatory elements. Remarkably, Ngn3-GFP is only expressed in approximately 40\% of LIN28-positive As (single) cells. The percentage of Ngn3-GFP-positive clusters increases dramatically with the chain length of interconnected spermatogonia. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that LIN28 specifically marks undifferentiated spermatogonia in mice. These data, together with previous studies, suggest that the LIN28-expressing undifferentiated spermatogonia exist as two subpopulations: Ngn3-GFP-negative (high stem cell potential) and Ngn3-GFP-positive (high differentiation commitment). Furthermore, Ngn3-GFP-negative cells are found in chains of Ngn3-GFP-positive spermatogonia, suggesting that cells in the Aal spermatogonia could revert to a more primitive state.},

  abstract = {The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. Prdm9 is the only mammalian speciation gene yet identified and is responsible for sterility phenotypes in male hybrids of certain mouse subspecies. To investigate PRDM9 binding and its role in fertility and meiotic recombination, we humanized the DNA-binding domain of PRDM9 in C57BL/6 mice. This change repositions DSB hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9 binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the recombination process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions, and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility. Because such meiotic drive occurs across mammals, PRDM9 may play a wider, yet transient, role in the early stages of speciation.},

Methods employed included histological analysis on semi- and ultrathin sections, immunohistochemistry, morphometry, and hormone analysis in the blood serum. Histological analysis pointed out certain structural changes of macrophages and Leydig cells in NOA group of patients when compared to controls. In the testis interstitium, an increased presence of CD68 positive cells has been noted. Leydig cells in NOA patients displayed a kind of a mosaic picture across the same bioptic sample: both normal and damaged Leydig cells with pronounced vacuolisation and various intensity of expression of testosterone have been observed. Stereological analysis indicated a significant increase in volume density of both CD68 positive and vacuolated Leydig cells and a positive correlation between the volume densities of these cell types. The continuous gonadotropin overstimulation of Leydig cells, together with a negative paracrine action of macrophages, could result in the damage of steroidogenesis and deficit of testosterone in situ.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has been one of the methods of choice to isolate enriched populations of mammalian testicular germ cells. Currently, it allows the discrimination of up to 9 murine germ cell populations with high yield and purity. This high-resolution in discrimination and purification is possible due to unique changes in chromatin structure and quantity throughout spermatogenesis. These patterns can be captured by flow cytometry of male germ cells stained with fluorescent DNA-binding dyes such as Hoechst-33342 (Hoechst). Herein is a detailed description of a recently developed protocol to isolate mammalian testicular germ cells. Briefly, single cell suspensions are generated from testicular tissue by mechanical dissociation, double stained with Hoechst and propidium iodide (PI) and processed by flow cytometry. A serial gating strategy, including the selection of live cells (PI negative) with different DNA content (Hoechst intensity), is used during FACS sorting to discriminate up to 5 germ cell types. These include, with corresponding average purities (determined by microscopy evaluation): spermatogonia (66\%), primary (71\%) and secondary (85\%) spermatocytes, and spermatids (90\%), further separated into round (93\%) and elongating (87\%) subpopulations. Execution of the entire workflow is straightforward, allows the isolation of 4 cell types simultaneously with the appropriate FACS machine, and can be performed in less than 2 h. As reduced processing time is crucial to preserve the physiology of ex vivo cells, this method is ideal for downstream high-throughput studies of male germ cell biology. Moreover, a standardized protocol for multispecies purification of mammalian germ cells eliminates methodological sources of variables and allows a single set of reagents to be used for different animal models.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process that involves the successive and simultaneous execution of three different gene expression programs: mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Testicular cell heterogeneity has hindered its molecular analyses. Moreover, the characterization of short, poorly represented cell stages such as initial meiotic prophase ones (leptotene and zygotene) has remained elusive, despite their crucial importance for understanding the fundamentals of meiosis. RESULTS: We have developed a flow cytometry-based approach for obtaining highly pure stage-specific spermatogenic cell populations, including early meiotic prophase. Here we combined this methodology with next generation sequencing, which enabled the analysis of meiotic and postmeiotic gene expression signatures in mouse with unprecedented reliability. Interestingly, we found that a considerable number of genes involved in early as well as late meiotic processes are already on at early meiotic prophase, with a high proportion of them being expressed only for the short time lapse of lepto-zygotene stages. Besides, we observed a massive change in gene expression patterns during medium meiotic prophase (pachytene) when mostly genes related to spermiogenesis and sperm function are already turned on. This indicates that the transcriptional switch from meiosis to post-meiosis takes place very early, during meiotic prophase, thus disclosing a higher incidence of post-transcriptional regulation in spermatogenesis than previously reported. Moreover, we found that a good proportion of the differential gene expression in spermiogenesis corresponds to up-regulation of genes whose expression starts earlier, at pachytene stage; this includes transition protein-and protamine-coding genes, which have long been claimed to switch on during spermiogenesis. In addition, our results afford new insights concerning X chromosome meiotic inactivation and reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides for the first time an overview of the time course for the massive onset and turning off of the meiotic and spermiogenic genetic programs. Importantly, our data represent a highly reliable information set about gene expression in pure testicular cell populations including early meiotic prophase, for further data mining towards the elucidation of the molecular bases of male reproduction in mammals.},

We show that GLIS3 is expressed in gonocytes, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and spermatogonial progenitors (SPCs), but not in differentiated spermatogonia and later stages of spermatogenesis or in somatic cells. Spermatogenesis is greatly impaired in GLIS3 knockout mice. Loss of GLIS3 function causes a moderate reduction in the number of gonocytes, but greatly affects the generation of SSCs/SPCs, and as a consequence the development of spermatocytes. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that the expression of genes associated with undifferentiated spermatogonia was dramatically decreased in GLIS3-deficient mice and that the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of FOXO1, which marks the gonocyte-to-SSC transition and is necessary for SSC self-renewal, is inhibited. These observations suggest that GLIS3 promotes the gonocyte-to-SSC transition and is a critical regulator of the dynamics of early postnatal spermatogenesis. Stem Cells 2016;34:2772-2783.},

Testicular biopsy is also performed in men with risk factors for testicular malignancy. In a subgroup of infertile men, there is an increased risk for carcinoma in situ of the testis, especially in men with a history of cryptorchidism and testicular malignancy and in men with testicular atrophy. Ultrasonographic abnormalities, such as testicular microlithiasis, inhomogeneous parenchyma and lesions of the testes, further increase the risk of carcinoma in situ (CIS) in these men. For an accurate histological classification, proper tissue handling, fixation, preparation of the specimen and evaluation are needed. A standardized approach to testicular biopsy is recommended. In addition, approaches to the detection of CIS of the testis testicular immunohistochemistry are mandatory. In this mini-review, we describe the current indications for testicular biopsies in the diagnosis and management of male infertility.},

  abstract = {Many interacting proteins regulate and/or assist the activities of RAD51, a recombinase which plays a critical role in both DNA repair and meiotic recombination. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library revealed a new protein, RAD51AP2 (RAD51 Associated Protein 2), that interacts strongly with RAD51. A full-length cDNA clone predicts a novel vertebrate-specific protein of 1159 residues, and the RAD51AP2 transcript was observed only in meiotic tissue (i.e. adult testis and fetal ovary), suggesting a meiotic-specific function for RAD51AP2. In HEK293 cells the interaction of RAD51 with an ectopically-expressed recombinant large fragment of RAD51AP2 requires the C-terminal 57 residues of RAD51AP2. This RAD51-binding region shows 81\% homology to the C-terminus of RAD51AP1/PIR51, an otherwise totally unrelated RAD51-binding partner that is ubiquitously expressed. Analyses using truncations and point mutations in both RAD51AP1 and RAD51AP2 demonstrate that these proteins use the same structural motif for RAD51 binding. RAD54 shares some homology with this RAD51-binding motif, but this homologous region plays only an accessory role to the adjacent main RAD51-interacting region, which has been narrowed here to 40 amino acids. A novel protein, RAD51AP2, has been discovered that interacts with RAD51 through a C-terminal motif also present in RAD51AP1.},

The activity of SPO11 is controlled by multiple factors and regulatory mechanisms, such that the number of DSBs is limited and DSBs form at distinct positions in the genome and at the right time. Loss of this control can affect genome integrity or cause meiotic arrest by mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here we focus on the DSB-responsive kinase ATM and its functions in regulating meiotic DSB numbers and distribution. We review the recently discovered roles of ATM in this context, discuss their evolutionary conservation, and examine future research perspectives.},

RPA, a ubiquitous complex essential to recombination, is thought to play a similar role during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MEIOB, a meiosis-specific factor with unknown molecular function, ressembles a RPA subunit. Here we use in vivo approaches to show that in mouse spermatocytes, DMC1 and RAD51 appear to be normally loaded in the absence of MEIOB but are prematurely lost from unrepaired recombination sites. This loss correlates with an accumulation of the BLM helicase on meiotic chromosomes. We also show that MEIOB alters the immunodetection of RPA subunits at meiotic recombination sites. Using electron microscopy and purified proteins, we demonstrate that the MEIOB-SPATA22 complex associates with and modifies the conformation of RPA-coated ssDNA. Finally, we identify structural homology between MEIOB, SPATA22 and RPA subunits, and show that MEIOB and SPATA22 interact through C-terminal OB-fold containing domains (OBCDs) like RPA subunits. Moreover, MEIOB and SPATA22 cooperate to interact with RPA through their OBCDs. Our results suggest that MEIOB, SPATA22 and RPA work together to ensure proper processing of meiotic recombination intermediates.},

We show that the KRAB domain of PRDM9 forms complexes with additional proteins to allow hotspots to proceed into the next phase of recombination. By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and coimmunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that directly interact with PRDM9's KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and CDYL. These proteins are coexpressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1. Our results suggest a model in which PRDM9-bound hotspot DNA is brought to the chromosomal axis by the action of these proteins, ensuring the proper chromatin and spatial environment for subsequent recombination events.},

Recombinase recruited to the DSBs by the mediator protein BRCA2 catalyzes the homology-directed repair. During meiotic HR, programmed DSBs are introduced genome-wide but their repair mechanisms, including the regulation of BRCA2, have remained largely elusive. Here we identify a meiotic localizer of BRCA2, MEILB2/HSF2BP, that localizes to the site of meiotic DSBs in mice. Disruption of Meilb2 abolishes the localization of RAD51 and DMC1 recombinases in spermatocytes, leading to errors in DSB repair and male sterility. MEILB2 directly binds to BRCA2 and regulates its association to meiotic DSBs. We map the MEILB2-binding domain within BRCA2 that is distinct from the canonical DNA-binding domain but is sufficient to localize to meiotic DSBs in a MEILB2-dependent manner. We conclude that localization of BRCA2 to meiotic DSBs is mediated by MEILB2, which is an integral mechanism to repair abundant meiotic DSBs.},

This study was aimed to investigate for the first time the existence, distribution and characteristics of telocytes in normal human testis by an integrated morphological approach (immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy). We found that telocytes displaying typical long and moniliform prolongations and coexpressing CD34 and PDGFRα formed networks in the outer layer of peritubular tissue and around Leydig cells and vessels in the intertubular stroma. Testicular telocytes were immunophenotypically negative for CD31, c-kit/CD117 as well as α-SMA, thus making them clearly distinguishable from myoid cells/myofibroblasts located in the inner layer of peritubular tissue. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of cells ultrastructurally identifiable as telocytes (i.e. cells with telopodes alternating podomers and podoms) in the aforementioned locations. Intercellular contacts between neighboring telocytes and telopodes were observed throughout the testicular stromal compartment. Telopodes intimately surrounded and often established close contacts with peritubular myoid cells/myofibroblasts, Leydig cells and vessels. Extracellular vesicles were also frequently detected near telopodes. In summary, we demonstrated that telocytes are a previously neglected stromal component of human testis with potential implications in tissue homeostasis deserving further investigation.},

MEIOB (meiosis specific with OB domains), a meiosis-specific single-stranded DNA-binding homolog of replication protein A1 (RPA1), is essential for meiotic recombination. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of MEIOB by characterizing its binding partners spermatogenesis associated 22 (SPATA22) and RPA. We find that MEIOB and SPATA22 form an obligate complex and contain defined interaction domains. The interaction between these two proteins is unusual in that nearly any deletion in the binding domains abolishes the interaction. Strikingly, a single residue D383 in MEIOB is indispensable for the interaction. The MEIOB/SPATA22 complex interacts with the RPA heterotrimeric complex in a collaborative manner. Furthermore, MEIOB and SPATA22 are recruited to induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) together but not alone. These results demonstrate the cooperative property of the MEIOB-SPATA22 complex in its interaction with RPA and recruitment to DSBs.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossovers are produced when programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by recombination from homologous chromosomes (homologues). In a wide variety of organisms, meiotic HORMA-domain proteins are required to direct DSB repair towards homologues. This inter-homologue bias is required for efficient homology search, homologue alignment, and crossover formation. HORMA-domain proteins are also implicated in other processes related to crossover formation, including DSB formation, inhibition of promiscuous formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), and the meiotic prophase checkpoint that monitors both DSB processing and SCs. We examined the behavior of two previously uncharacterized meiosis-specific mouse HORMA-domain proteins–HORMAD1 and HORMAD2–in wild-type mice and in mutants defective in DSB processing or SC formation. HORMADs are preferentially associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes throughout meiotic prophase. We observe a strong negative correlation between SC formation and presence of HORMADs on axes, and a positive correlation between the presumptive sites of high checkpoint-kinase ATR activity and hyper-accumulation of HORMADs on axes. HORMADs are not depleted from chromosomes in mutants that lack SCs. In contrast, DSB formation and DSB repair are not absolutely required for depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes. A simple interpretation of these findings is that SC formation directly or indirectly promotes depletion of HORMADs from chromosome axes. We also find that TRIP13 protein is required for reciprocal distribution of HORMADs and the SYCP1/SC-component along chromosome axes. Similarities in mouse and budding yeast meiosis suggest that TRIP13/Pch2 proteins have a conserved role in establishing mutually exclusive HORMAD-rich and synapsed chromatin domains in both mouse and yeast. Taken together, our observations raise the possibility that involvement of meiotic HORMA-domain proteins in the regulation of homologue interactions is conserved in mammals.},

Meiotic recombination initiates with the formation and resection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cellular responses to meiotic DSBs are critical for efficient repair and quality control, but molecular features of these remain poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Here we report that the DNA damage response protein kinase ATR is crucial for meiotic recombination and completion of meiotic prophase in mice. Using a hypomorphic Atr mutation and pharmacological inhibition of ATR in vivo and in cultured spermatocytes, we show that ATR, through its effector kinase CHK1, promotes efficient RAD51 and DMC1 assembly at RPA-coated resected DSB sites and establishment of interhomolog connections during meiosis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that ATR promotes local accumulation of recombination markers on unsynapsed axes during meiotic prophase to favor homologous chromosome synapsis. These data reveal that ATR plays multiple roles in mammalian meiotic recombination.},

The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), h-caldesmon, CD34, and CD31 were immunohistochemically examined in all cases. The tunica albuginea and the inner layer of seminiferous tubules in adult testis were predominantly composed of myofibroblasts. Smooth muscle cells were also scattered throughout these sites in some cases. CD34-positive stromal cells were abundant, and they formed a reticular network around the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells as well as the outer layer of seminiferous tubules. Moreover, myofibroblasts and the CD34 reticular network were already present in the testicular stroma during fetal or neonatal development. Double immunostaining of fetal, neonatal and adult testes using ASMA and CD34 confirmed that myofibroblasts and CD34-positive stromal cells were present in the inner and outer layers of peritubular tissue, respectively. This distribution and cytological identification was also confirmed by an ultrastructural study of four cases. Finally, CD34-positive stromal cells and myofibroblasts are major components of human testicular stroma.},

We demonstrate the utility of flashpca on both HapMap3 and on a large Immunochip dataset. For the latter, flashpca performed PCA of 15,000 individuals up to 125 times faster than existing tools, with identical results, and PCA of 150,000 individuals using flashpca completed in 4 hours. The increasing size of SNP datasets will make tools such as flashpca essential as traditional approaches will not adequately scale. This approach will also help to scale other applications that leverage PCA or eigen-decomposition to substantially larger datasets.},

Using functional genomics, we identify KDM2B, a histone demethylase and component of a non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1), as selectively required for sustaining synovial sarcoma cell transformation. SS18-SSX1 physically interacts with PRC1.1 and co-associates with SWI/SNF and KDM2B complexes on unmethylated CpG islands. Via KDM2B, SS18-SSX1 binds and aberrantly activates expression of developmentally regulated genes otherwise targets of polycomb-mediated repression, which is restored upon KDM2B depletion, leading to irreversible mesenchymal differentiation. Thus, SS18-SSX1 deregulates developmental programs to drive transformation by hijacking a transcriptional repressive complex to aberrantly activate gene expression.},

SCUBA draws techniques from nonlinear dynamics and stochastic differential equation theories, providing a systematic framework for modeling complex processes involving multilineage specifications. By applying SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

In mutant spermatocytes, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed, but localization of the recombination proteins RAD51 and DMC1 to meiotic chromosomes is severely impaired.

The pathway in eukaryotes consists of the DNA-binding components, which are the homologs of the bacterial MutS protein (MSH 2 6), and the MutL homologs, which bind to the MutS homologs and are essential for the repair process. Three of the six homologs of MutS that function in these processes, Msh2, Msh3 and Msh6, are involved in the mismatch repair of mutations, frameshifts and replication errors, and two others, Msh4 and Msh5, have specific roles in meiosis. Of the four MutL homologs, Mlh1, Mlh3, Pms1 and Pms2, three are involved in mismatch repair and at least two, Pms2 and Mlh1, are essential for meiotic progression in both yeast and mice. To assess the role of Mlh3 in mammalian meiosis, we have generated and characterized Mlh3(-/-) mice. Here we show that Mlh3(-/-) mice are viable but sterile. Mlh3 is required for Mlh1 binding to meiotic chromosomes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes from the mid pachynema stage of prophase I. Mlh3(-/-) spermatocytes reach metaphase before succumbing to apoptosis, but oocytes fail to complete meiosis I after fertilization.

Here we show that human SYCP3 forms a highly-elongated helical tetramer of 20 nm length. N-terminal sequences extending from each end of the rod-like structure bind double-stranded DNA, enabling SYCP3 to link distant sites along the sister chromatid. We further find that SYCP3 self-assembles into regular filamentous structures that resemble the known morphology of the SC lateral element. Together, our data form the basis for a model in which SYCP3 binding and assembly on meiotic chromosomes leads to their organisation into compact structures compatible with recombination and crossover formation.},

DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging datasets from human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

  abstract = {We describe a pathway by which the master transcription factor PU.1 regulates human monocyte/macrophage differentiation. This includes miR-424 and the transcriptional factor NFI-A. We show that PU.1 and these two components are interlinked in a finely tuned temporal and regulatory circuitry: PU.1 activates the transcription of miR-424, and this up-regulation is involved in stimulating monocyte differentiation through miR-424-dependent translational repression of NFI-A. In turn, the decrease in NFI-A levels is important for the activation of differentiation-specific genes such as M-CSFr. In line with these data, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-424 in precursor cells enhance monocytic differentiation, whereas the ectopic expression of NFI-A has an opposite effect. The interplay among these three components was demonstrated in myeloid cell lines as well as in human CD34+ differentiation. These data point to the important role of miR-424 and NFI-A in controlling the monocyte/macrophage differentiation program.},

We characterized a structural homolog of the archaeal topo VIB subunit [meiotic topoisomerase VIB-like (MTOPVIB)], which is essential for meiotic DSB formation.

This is associated with perturbation of synaptonemal complex morphogenesis, repair and regulation of crossover formation. To further assess the Mre11 complex's role in meiotic progression, we identified testis-specific NBS1-interacting proteins via two-hybrid screening in yeast. In this screen, Zip4h (Tex11), a male germ cell specific X-linked gene was isolated. Based on sequence and predicted structural similarity to the S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana Zip4 orthologs, ZIP4H appears to be the mammalian ortholog. In S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana, Zip4 is a meiosis-specific protein that regulates the level of meiotic crossovers, thus influencing homologous chromosome segregation in these organisms. As is true for hypomorphic Nbs1 (Nbs1(DeltaB/DeltaB)) mice, Zip4h(-/Y) mutant mice were fertile. Analysis of spermatocytes revealed a delay in meiotic double strand break repair and decreased crossover formation as inferred from DMC1 and MLH1 staining patterns, respectively. Achiasmate chromosomes at the first meiotic division were also observed in Zip4h(-/Y) mutants, consistent with the observed reduction in MLH1 focus formation. These results indicate that meiotic functions of Zip4 family members are conserved and support the view that the Mre11 complex and ZIP4H interact functionally during the execution of the meiotic program in mammals.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \$\textbackslash{}times\$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

Germline genome integrity requires spatiotemporal control of DSB formation, which involves the proteinaceous chromosome axis along the core of each meiotic chromosome. In particular, a component of unsynapsed axes, HORMAD1, promotes DSB formation in unsynapsed regions where DSB formation must occur to ensure completion of synapsis. Despite its importance, the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. We identify CCDC36 as a direct interactor of HORMAD1 (IHO1) that is essential for DSB formation. Underpinning this function, IHO1 and conserved SPO11-auxiliary proteins MEI4 and REC114 assemble chromatin-bound recombinosomes that are predicted activators of DSB formation. HORMAD1 is needed for robust recruitment of IHO1 to unsynapsed axes and efficient formation and/or stabilization of these recombinosomes. Thus, we propose that HORMAD1-IHO1 interaction provides a mechanism for the selective promotion of DSB formation along unsynapsed chromosome axes.},

Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},

Many of the components necessary for this structure have been identified through the study of cytokinesis in Drosophila; however, mammalian intercellular bridges have distinct properties from those of insects. Mammalian germ cell intercellular bridges are composed of general cytokinesis components with additional germ cell-specific factors including TEX14. TEX14 is an inactive kinase essential for the maintenance of stable intercellular bridges in gametes of both sexes but whose loss specifically impairs male meiosis. TEX14 acts to impede the terminal steps of abscission by competing for essential component CEP55, blocking its interaction in nongerm cells with ALIX and TSG101. Additionally, TEX14-interacting protein RBM44, whose localization in stabile intercellular bridges is limited to pachytene and secondary spermatocytes, may participate in processes such as RNA transport but is nonessential to the maintenance of intercellular bridge stability.},

  abstract = {Mammalian females have two X chromosomes, while males have only one X plus a Y chromosome. In order to balance X-linked gene dosage between the sexes, one X chromosome undergoes inactivation during development of female embryos. This process has been termed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Inactivation of the single X chromosome also occurs in the male, but is transient and is confined to the late stages of first meiotic prophase during spermatogenesis. This phenomenon has been termed meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). A substantial portion ( approximately 15-25\%) of X-linked mRNA-encoding genes escapes XCI in female somatic cells. While no mRNA genes are known to escape MSCI in males, approximately 80\% of X-linked miRNA genes have been shown to escape this process. Recent results have led to the proposal that the RNA interference mechanism may be involved in regulating XCI in female cells. We suggest that some MSCI-escaping miRNAs may play a similar role in regulating MSCI in male germ cells.},

  abstract = {The Cullin-RING ubiquitin-ligase CRL4 controls cell cycle and DNA damage checkpoint response and ensures genomic integrity. Inactivation of the Cul4 component of the CRL4 E3 ligase complex in Caenorhabditis elegans by RNA interference results in massive mitotic DNA re-replication in the blast cells, largely due to failed degradation of the DNA licensing protein, CDT-1, and premature spermatogenesis. Here we show that inactivation of Cul4a by gene-targeting in mice only affected male but not female fertility. This male infertility phenotype resulted from a combination of decreased spermatozoa number, reduced sperm motility and defective acrosome formation. Agenesis of the mutant germ cells was accompanied by increased cell death in pachytene/diplotene cells with markedly elevated levels of phospho-p53 and CDT-1. Despite apparent normal assembly of synaptonemal complexes and DNA double strand break repair, dissociation of MLH1, a component of the late recombination nodule, was delayed in Cul4a -/- diplotene spermatocytes, which potentially led to subsequent disruptions in meiosis II and spermiogenesis. Together, our study revealed an indispensable role for Cul4a during male germ cell meiosis.},

  abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) capable of self-renewal and differentiation are the foundation for spermatogenesis. Although several factors important for these processes have been identified, the fundamental mechanisms regulating SSC self-renewal and differentiation remain unknown. Here, we investigated a role for the Foxo transcription factors in mouse spermatogenesis and found that Foxo1 specifically marks mouse gonocytes and a subset of spermatogonia with stem cell potential. Genetic analyses showed that Foxo1 was required for both SSC homeostasis and the initiation of spermatogenesis. Combined deficiency of Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4 resulted in a severe impairment of SSC self-renewal and a complete block of differentiation, indicating that Foxo3 and Foxo4, although dispensable for male fertility, contribute to SSC function. By conditional inactivation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in the male germ line, we found that PI3K signaling regulates Foxo1 stability and subcellular localization, revealing that the Foxos are pivotal effectors of PI3K-Akt signaling in SSCs. We also identified a network of Foxo gene targets–most notably Ret–that rationalized the maintenance of SSCs by the Foxos. These studies demonstrate that Foxo1 expression in the spermatogenic lineage is intimately associated with the stem cell state and revealed what we believe to be novel Foxo-dependent mechanisms underlying SSC self-renewal and differentiation, with implications for common diseases, including male infertility and testicular cancer, due to abnormalities in SSC function.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossover formation between homologous chromosomes (homologues) entails DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, homology search using DSB ends, and synaptonemal-complex formation coupled with DSB repair. Meiotic progression must be prevented until DSB repair and homologue alignment are completed, to avoid the formation of aneuploid gametes. Here we show that mouse HORMAD1 ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DSBs are available for successful homology search. HORMAD1 is needed for normal synaptonemal-complex formation and for the efficient recruitment of ATR checkpoint kinase activity to unsynapsed chromatin. The latter phenomenon was proposed to be important in meiotic prophase checkpoints in both sexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, HORMAD1 is essential for the elimination of synaptonemal-complex-defective oocytes. Synaptonemal-complex formation results in HORMAD1 depletion from chromosome axes. Thus, we propose that the synaptonemal complex and HORMAD1 are key components of a negative feedback loop that coordinates meiotic progression with homologue alignment: HORMAD1 promotes homologue alignment and synaptonemal-complex formation, and synaptonemal complexes downregulate HORMAD1 function, thereby permitting progression past meiotic prophase checkpoints.},

Crossovers exhibit a mutagenic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of crossovers in males and females. In females, a higher mutation rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from crossovers, particularly for complex crossovers, which increase with maternal age.

Meiosis-specific proteins TERB1, TERB2 and MAJIN play a key role in this process. Here, we report the crystal structures of human TERB1-TERB2 and TERB2-MAJIN subcomplexes. Specific disruption of the TERB1-TERB2 or the TERB2-MAJIN interaction in the mouse Terb2 gene abolishes the telomere attachment to the NE and causes aberrant homologous pairing and disordered synapsis. In addition, depletion of SUN1 also partially disrupts the telomere-NE connection. We propose that the telomere-TRF1-TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN-NE interaction network and the telomere-LINC complex connection are likely two separate but cooperative pathways to stably recruit telomeres to the NE in meiosis prophase I. Our work provides a molecular model of the connection between telomeres and the NE and reveals the correlation between aberrant synapsis and the defective telomere attachment to the NE.},

  abstract = {In somatic cells, BRCA2 is needed for RAD51-mediated homologous recombination. The meiosis-specific DNA strand exchange protein, DMC1, promotes the formation of DNA strand invasion products (joint molecules) between homologous molecules in a fashion similar to RAD51. BRCA2 interacts directly with both human RAD51 and DMC1; in the case of RAD51, this interaction results in stimulation of RAD51-promoted DNA strand exchange. However, for DMC1, little is known regarding the basis and functional consequences of its interaction with BRCA2. Here we report that human DMC1 interacts directly with each of the BRC repeats of BRCA2, albeit most tightly with repeats 1-3 and 6-8. However, BRC1-3 bind with higher affinity to RAD51 than to DMC1, whereas BRC6-8 bind with higher affinity to DMC1, providing potential spatial organization to nascent filament formation. With the exception of BRC4, each BRC repeat stimulates joint molecule formation by DMC1. The basis for this stimulation is an enhancement of DMC1-ssDNA complex formation by the stimulatory BRC repeats. Lastly, we demonstrate that full-length BRCA2 protein stimulates DMC1-mediated DNA strand exchange between RPA-ssDNA complexes and duplex DNA, thus identifying BRCA2 as a mediator of DMC1 recombination function. Collectively, our results suggest unique and specialized functions for the BRC motifs of BRCA2 in promoting homologous recombination in meiotic and mitotic cells.},

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.},

  abstract = {Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis requires that homologous chromosomes associate and recombine. Chiasmata, the cytological manifestation of recombination, provide the physical link that holds the homologs together as a pair, facilitating their orientation on the spindle at meiosis I. Formation of most crossover (CO) events requires the assistance of a group of proteins collectively known as ZMM. HFM1/Mer3 is in this group of proteins and is required for normal progression of homologous recombination and proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes in a number of model organisms. Our work is the first study in mammals showing the in vivo function of mouse HFM1. Cytological observations suggest that initial steps of recombination are largely normal in a majority of Hfm1(-/-) spermatocytes. Intermediate and late stages of recombination appear aberrant, as chromosomal localization of MSH4 is altered and formation of MLH1foci is drastically reduced. In agreement, chiasma formation is reduced, and cells arrest with subsequent apoptosis at diakinesis. Our results indicate that deletion of Hfm1 leads to the elimination of a major fraction but not all COs. Formation of chromosome axial elements and homologous pairing is apparently normal, and Hfm1(-/-) spermatocytes progress to the end of prophase I without apparent developmental delay or apoptosis. However, synapsis is altered with components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex frequently failing to extend the full length of the chromosome axes. We propose that initial steps of recombination are sufficient to support homology recognition, pairing, and initial chromosome synapsis and that HFM1 is required to form normal numbers of COs and to complete synapsis.},

The detection of the germ cell-specific proteins Nanos2 and Nanos3 as markers of spermatogonia has enabled the clear dissection of complex populations of these cells as Nanos2 was recently shown to be involved in the maintenance of stem cells. Nanos2 is found to be almost exclusively expressed in A(s) to A(pr) cells, whereas Nanos3 is detectable in most undifferentiated spermatogonia (A(s) to A(al)) and differentiating A(1) spermatogonia.

  abstract = {The mouse (Mus musculus) is the premier animal model for understanding human disease and development. Here we show that a comprehensive understanding of mouse biology is only possible with the availability of a finished, high-quality genome assembly. The finished clone-based assembly of the mouse strain C57BL/6J reported here has over 175,000 fewer gaps and over 139 Mb more of novel sequence, compared with the earlier MGSCv3 draft genome assembly. In a comprehensive analysis of this revised genome sequence, we are now able to define 20,210 protein-coding genes, over a thousand more than predicted in the human genome (19,042 genes). In addition, we identified 439 long, non-protein-coding RNAs with evidence for transcribed orthologs in human. We analyzed the complex and repetitive landscape of 267 Mb of sequence that was missing or misassembled in the previously published assembly, and we provide insights into the reasons for its resistance to sequencing and assembly by whole-genome shotgun approaches. Duplicated regions within newly assembled sequence tend to be of more recent ancestry than duplicates in the published draft, correcting our initial understanding of recent evolution on the mouse lineage. These duplicates appear to be largely composed of sequence regions containing transposable elements and duplicated protein-coding genes; of these, some may be fixed in the mouse population, but at least 40\% of segmentally duplicated sequences are copy number variable even among laboratory mouse strains. Mouse lineage-specific regions contain 3,767 genes drawn mainly from rapidly-changing gene families associated with reproductive functions. The finished mouse genome assembly, therefore, greatly improves our understanding of rodent-specific biology and allows the delineation of ancestral biological functions that are shared with human from derived functions that are not.},

More than 200 different CRLs are divided into seven families according to their cullin scaffolding proteins (CUL1-7) around which they are assembled. Research over two decades has revealed that different CRL families are specialized to fulfill specific cellular functions. Whereas many CUL1-based CRLs (CRL1s) ubiquitylate cell cycle regulators, CRL4 complexes often associate with chromatin to control DNA metabolism. Based on studies about differentiation programs of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including myogenesis, neurogenesis, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis, we propose here that CRL3 complexes evolved to fulfill a pivotal role in mammalian cell differentiation.},

The synaptonemal complex is a 'zipper'-like protein assembly that synapses homologue pairs together and provides the structural framework for processing recombination sites into crossovers. Humans show individual differences in the number of crossovers generated across the genome. Recently, an anonymous gene variant in C14ORF39/SIX6OS1 was identified that influences the recombination rate in humans. Here we show that C14ORF39/SIX6OS1 encodes a component of the central element of the synaptonemal complex. Yeast two-hybrid analysis reveals that SIX6OS1 interacts with the well-established protein synaptonemal complex central element 1 (SYCE1). Mice lacking SIX6OS1 are defective in chromosome synapsis at meiotic prophase I, which provokes an arrest at the pachytene-like stage and results in infertility. In accordance with its role as a modifier of the human recombination rate, SIX6OS1 is essential for the appropriate processing of intermediate recombination nodules before crossover formation.},

To explore factors that affect binding and subsequent recombination outcomes, we mapped human PRDM9 binding sites in a transfected human cell line and measured PRDM9-induced histone modifications. These data reveal varied DNA-binding modalities of PRDM9. We also find that human PRDM9 frequently binds promoters, despite their low recombination rates, and it can activate expression of a small number of genes including and . Furthermore, we identify specific sequence motifs that predict consistent, localized meiotic recombination suppression around a subset of PRDM9 binding sites. These motifs strongly associate with KRAB-ZNF protein binding, TRIM28 recruitment, and specific histone modifications. Finally, we demonstrate that, in addition to binding DNA, PRDM9's zinc fingers also mediate its multimerization, and we show that a pair of highly diverged alleles preferentially form homo-multimers.},

In mice, the DNA damage-regulated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) ATM regulates all of these processes. However, the meiotic functions of the PIKK ATR have remained elusive, because germline-specific depletion of this kinase is challenging. Here we uncover roles for ATR in male mouse prophase I progression. ATR deletion causes chromosome axis fragmentation and germ cell elimination at mid pachynema. This elimination cannot be rescued by deletion of ATM and the third DNA damage-regulated PIKK, PRKDC, consistent with the existence of a PIKK-independent surveillance mechanism in the mammalian germline. ATR is required for synapsis, in a manner genetically dissociable from DSB formation. ATR also regulates loading of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 to DSBs and recombination focus dynamics on synapsed and asynapsed chromosomes. Our studies reveal ATR as a critical regulator of mouse meiosis.},

  abstract = {The heterogeneous nature of cell types in the testis and the absence of meiotic cell culture models have been significant hurdles to the study of the unique differentiation programs that are manifest during meiosis. Two principal methods have been developed to purify, to varying degrees, various meiotic fractions from both adult and immature animals: elutriation or Staput (sedimentation) using BSA and/or percoll gradients. Both of these methods rely on cell size and density to separate meiotic cells. Overall, except for few cell populations, these protocols fail to yield sufficient purity of the numerous meiotic cell populations that are necessary for detailed molecular analyses. Moreover, with such methods usually one type of meiotic cells can be purified at a given time, which adds an extra level of complexity regarding the reproducibility and homogeneity when comparing meiotic cell samples. Here, we describe a refined method that allows one to easily visualize, identify, and purify meiotic cells, from germ cells to round spermatids, using FACS combined with Hoechst 33342 staining. This method provides an overall snapshot of the entire meiotic process and allows one to highly purify viable cells from most stage of meiosis. These purified cells can then be analyzed in detail for molecular changes that accompany progression through meiosis, for example changes in gene expression and the dynamics of nucleosome occupancy at hotspots of meiotic recombination.},

  abstract = {The Msh4-Msh5 protein complex in eukaryotes is involved in stabilizing Holliday junctions and its progenitors to facilitate crossing over during Meiosis I. These functions of the Msh4-Msh5 complex are essential for proper chromosomal segregation during the first meiotic division. The Msh4/5 proteins are homologous to the bacterial mismatch repair protein MutS and other MutS homologs (Msh2, Msh3, Msh6). Saccharomyces cerevisiae msh4/5 point mutants were identified recently that show two fold reduction in crossing over, compared to wild-type without affecting chromosome segregation. Three distinct classes of msh4/5 point mutations could be sorted based on their meiotic phenotypes. These include msh4/5 mutations that have a) crossover and viability defects similar to msh4/5 null mutants; b) intermediate defects in crossing over and viability and c) defects only in crossing over. The absence of a crystal structure for the Msh4-Msh5 complex has hindered an understanding of the structural aspects of Msh4-Msh5 function as well as molecular explanation for the meiotic defects observed in msh4/5 mutations. To address this problem, we generated a structural model of the S. cerevisiae Msh4-Msh5 complex using homology modeling. Further, structural analysis tailored with evolutionary information is used to predict sites with potentially critical roles in Msh4-Msh5 complex formation, DNA binding and to explain asymmetry within the Msh4-Msh5 complex. We also provide a structural rationale for the meiotic defects observed in the msh4/5 point mutations. The mutations are likely to affect stability of the Msh4/5 proteins and/or interactions with DNA. The Msh4-Msh5 model will facilitate the design and interpretation of new mutational data as well as structural studies of this important complex involved in meiotic chromosome segregation.},

Here we have combined a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis with immunohistochemistry-based protein profiling to characterize the molecular components of the testis. Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) of normal human testicular tissue from seven individuals was performed and compared with 26 other normal human tissue types. All 20 050 putative human genes were classified into categories based on expression patterns. The analysis shows that testis is the tissue with the most tissue-specific genes by far. More than 1000 genes show a testis-enriched expression pattern in testis when compared with all other analyzed tissues. Highly testis enriched genes were further characterized with respect to protein localization within the testis, such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, sperm, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Here we present an immunohistochemistry-based analysis, showing the localization of corresponding proteins in different cell types and various stages of spermatogenesis, for 62 genes expressed at {$>$}50-fold higher levels in testis when compared with other tissues. A large fraction of these genes were unexpectedly expressed in early stages of spermatogenesis. In conclusion, we have applied a genome-wide analysis to identify the human testis-specific proteome using transcriptomics and antibody-based protein profiling, providing lists of genes expressed in a tissue-enriched manner in the testis. The majority of these genes and proteins were previously poorly characterised in terms of localization and function, and our list provides an important starting point to increase our molecular understanding of human reproductive biology and disease.},

Testicular LDs contained multiple Rab GTPases, chaperones, and proteins involved in glucuronidation, ubiquination and transport, many known to modulate LD formation and LD-related cellular functions. In particular, testicular LDs contained many members of both the perilipin family and classical lipase/esterase superfamily assembled predominately in adipocyte LDs. Thus, testicular LDs might be regulated similar to adipocyte LDs. Remarkably, testicular LDs contained a large number of classical enzymes for biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol and hormonal steroids, so steroidogenic reactions might occur on testicular LDs or the steroidogenic enzymes and products could be transferred through testicular LDs. These characteristics differ from the LDs in most other types of cells, so testicular LDs could be an active organelle functionally involved in steroidogenesis.},

Considering deleterious mutations, evolution leads diploid mothers to strengthen selection among haploid sperm/pollen, because this reduces the mutation load inherited by their diploid offspring. If, however, selection acts in opposite directions in haploids and diploids (“ploidally antagonistic selection”), mothers evolve to reduce haploid selection to avoid selectively amplifying alleles harmful to their offspring. Consequently, with maternal control, selection in the haploid phase either is maximized or reaches an intermediate state, depending on the deleterious mutation rate relative to the extent of ploidally antagonistic selection. By contrast, evolution generally leads diploid fathers to mask mutations in their gametes to the maximum extent possible, whenever masking (e.g., through transcript sharing) increases the average fitness of a father's gametes. We discuss the implications of this maternal-paternal conflict over the extent of haploid selection and describe empirical studies needed to refine our understanding of haploid selection among seemingly diploid organisms.},

  abstract = {The Mei1(m1Jcs) allele contains a point mutation in a novel gene required for normal meiosis in male and female mice. We previously hypothesized that Mei1 is likely required for the formation of genetically programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), the initiating event of meiotic recombination because in mutant spermatocytes (1) RAD51 foci are greatly reduced at zygonema; (2) RAD51 foci can be restored by cisplatin-induced DNA damage; and (3) phosphorylated H2AX is greatly reduced at leptonema. If this hypothesis is correct, Mei1 would act upstream of genes required for repair of DSBs by homologous recombination. To test this, we examined meiosis in Mei(m1Jcs)/Mei1(m1Jcs) (Mei1(-/-)) and Dmc1(tm1Jcs)/Dmc1(tm1Jcs) (Dmc1(-/-)) mice and mice homozygous at both loci (Dmc1(-/-) Mei1(-/-)), exploiting the fact that oogenesis is much more severely affected by the absence of DMC1 than by the absence of MEI1. The phenotypes of both male and female double mutants were identical to that of Mei1(-/-) animals. Therefore, Mei1 can be positioned upstream of Dmc1 in the genetic pathway that operates during mammalian meiosis. Furthermore, this epistatic interaction provides additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that Mei1 is required for the initiating events of meiotic recombination.},

  abstract = {PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9) is a major regulator of the localization of meiotic recombination hotspots in the human and mouse genomes. This role involves its DNA-binding domain, which is composed of a tandem array of zinc fingers, and PRDM9-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4. PRDM9 is a member of the PRDM family of transcription regulators, but unlike other family members, it contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-related domain that is predicted to be a potential protein interaction domain. Here, we show that truncation of the KRAB domain of mouse PRDM9 leads to loss of PRDM9 function and altered meiotic prophase and gametogenesis. In addition, we identified proteins that interact with the KRAB domain of PRDM9 in yeast two-hybrid assay screens, particularly CXXC1, a member of the COMPASS complex. We also show that CXXC1 interacts with IHO1, an essential component of the meiotic double-strand break (DSB) machinery. As CXXC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spp1 that links DSB sites to the DSB machinery on the chromosome axis, we propose that these molecular interactions involved in the regulation of meiotic DSB formation are conserved in mouse meiosis.},

Lysine methylation is one of the major post-translational modifications involved in the regulation of chromatin function. The PWWP domain is a member of the Royal superfamily that functions as a chromatin methylation reader by recognizing both DNA and histone methylated lysines. The PWWP domain three-dimensional structure is based on an N-terminal hydrophobic β-barrel responsible for histone methyl-lysine binding, and a C-terminal α-helical domain. In this review, we set out to discuss the most recent literature on PWWP domains, focusing on their structural features and the mechanisms by which they specifically recognize DNA and histone methylated lysines at the level of the nucleosome.},

In comparison to other unsupervised clustering methods including K-means and hierarchical clustering, NMF has higher accuracy in separating similar groups in various datasets. We ranked genes by their importance scores (-scores) in separating these groups, and discovered that NMF uniquely identifies genes expressed at intermediate levels as top-ranked genes. Finally, we show that in conjugation with the modularity detection method FEM, NMF reveals meaningful protein-protein interaction modules. In summary, we propose that NMF is a desirable method to analyze heterogeneous single-cell RNA-Seq data.

After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

Here we demonstrate that fertility and the implementation of the meiotic programme require a previously uncharacterized meiosis-specific protein, MEIOC. Meioc invalidation in mice induces early and pleiotropic meiotic defects in males and females. MEIOC prevents meiotic transcript degradation and interacts with an RNA helicase that binds numerous meiotic mRNAs. Our results indicate that proper engagement into meiosis necessitates the specific stabilization of meiotic transcripts, a previously little-appreciated feature in mammals. Remarkably, the upregulation of MEIOC at the onset of meiosis does not require retinoic acid and STRA8 signalling. Thus, we propose that the complete induction of the meiotic programme requires both retinoic acid-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The latter process involving post-transcriptional regulation likely represents an ancestral mechanism, given that MEIOC homologues are conserved throughout multicellular animals.},

It is widely believed that, in most organisms, SPO11-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced during prophase I precede and are required for efficient homolog pairing. We now show that, in the mouse, a significant level of homolog pairing precedes programmed DNA cleavage. Strikingly, this early chromosome pairing still requires SPO11 but is not dependent on its ability to make DSBs or homologous recombination proteins. Intriguingly, SUN1, a protein required for telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and for post-DSB synapsis, is also required for early pre-DSB homolog pairing. Furthermore, pre-DSB pairing at telomeres persists upon entry into prophase I and is most likely important for initiation of synapsis. Our findings suggest that the DSB-triggered homology search may mainly serve to proofread and stabilize the pre-DSB pairing of homologous chromosomes.},

However, the way in which homologs recognize each other remains a fundamental issue in chromosome biology. Here, we show that homolog recognition or association initiates upon entry into meiotic prophase before axis assembly and double-strand break (DSB) formation. This homolog association develops into tight pairing only during or after axis formation. Intriguingly, the ability to recognize homologs is retained in Sun1 knockout spermatocytes, in which telomere-directed chromosome movement is abolished, and this is the case even in Spo11 knockout spermatocytes, in which DSB-dependent DNA homology search is absent. Disruption of meiosis-specific cohesin RAD21L precludes the initial association of homologs as well as the subsequent pairing in spermatocytes. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that homolog recognition is achieved primarily by searching for homology in the chromosome architecture as defined by meiosis-specific cohesin rather than in the DNA sequence itself.},

The homologues connect via axial elements and numerous transverse filaments to form the synaptonemal complex. The synaptonemal complex is a critical component for chromosome pairing, segregation, and recombination. We previously identified a novel germ cell-specific HORMA domain encoding gene, Hormad1, a member of the synaptonemal complex and a mammalian counterpart to the yeast meiotic HORMA domain protein Hop1. Hormad1 is essential for mammalian gametogenesis as knockout male and female mice are infertile. Hormad1 deficient (Hormad1(-/) (-)) testes exhibit meiotic arrest in the early pachytene stage, and synaptonemal complexes cannot be visualized by electron microscopy. Hormad1 deficiency does not affect localization of other synaptonemal complex proteins, SYCP2 and SYCP3, but disrupts homologous chromosome pairing. Double stranded break formation and early recombination events are disrupted in Hormad1(-/) (-) testes and ovaries as shown by the drastic decrease in the γH2AX, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA foci. HORMAD1 co-localizes with γH2AX to the sex body during pachytene. BRCA1, ATR, and γH2AX co-localize to the sex body and participate in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and transcriptional silencing. Hormad1 deficiency abolishes γH2AX, ATR, and BRCA1 localization to the sex chromosomes and causes transcriptional de-repression on the X chromosome. Unlike testes, Hormad1(-/) (-) ovaries have seemingly normal ovarian folliculogenesis after puberty. However, embryos generated from Hormad1(-/) (-) oocytes are hyper- and hypodiploid at the 2 cell and 8 cell stage, and they arrest at the blastocyst stage. HORMAD1 is therefore a critical component of the synaptonemal complex that affects synapsis, recombination, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and transcriptional silencing.},

One challenge to more fully exploit new experimental advances is the need to develop algorithms to provide an analysis at each of the relevant levels of detail. Here, the data analysis method non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been applied to the analysis of gene array experiments. Whereas current algorithms identify relationships on the basis of large-scale similarity between expression patterns, NMF is a recently developed machine learning technique capable of recognizing similarity between subportions of the data corresponding to localized features in expression space. A large data set consisting of 300 genome-wide expression measurements of yeast was used as sample data to illustrate the performance of the new approach. Local features detected are shown to map well to functional cellular subsystems. Functional relationships predicted by the new analysis are compared with those predicted using standard approaches; validation using bioinformatic databases suggests predictions using the new approach may be up to twice as accurate as some conventional approaches.},

  abstract = {Telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope (NE) is a prerequisite for chromosome movement during meiotic prophase I that is required for pairing of homologous chromosomes, synapsis, and homologous recombination. Here we show that Speedy A, a noncanonical activator of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), is specifically localized to telomeres in prophase I male and female germ cells in mice, and plays an essential role in the telomere-NE attachment. Deletion of Spdya in mice disrupts telomere-NE attachment, and this impairs homologous pairing and synapsis and leads to zygotene arrest in male and female germ cells. In addition, we have identified a telomere localization domain on Speedy A covering the distal N terminus and the Cdk2-binding Ringo domain, and this domain is essential for the localization of Speedy A to telomeres. Furthermore, we found that the binding of Cdk2 to Speedy A is indispensable for Cdk2's localization on telomeres, suggesting that Speedy A and Cdk2 might be the initial components that are recruited to the NE for forming the meiotic telomere complex. However, Speedy A-Cdk2-mediated telomere-NE attachment is independent of Cdk2 activation. Our results thus indicate that Speedy A and Cdk2 might mediate the initial telomere-NE attachment for the efficient assembly of the telomere complex that is essential for meiotic prophase I progression.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis consists broadly of three phases: proliferation of diploid germ cells, meiosis, and finally extensive differentiation of the haploid cells into effective delivery vehicles for the paternal genome. Despite detailed characterization of many haploid developmental steps leading to sperm, only fragmentary information exists on the control of gene expression underlying these processes. Here we report that the RFX2 transcription factor is a master regulator of genes required for the haploid phase. A targeted mutation of Rfx2 was created in mice. Rfx2-/- mice are perfectly viable but show complete male sterility. Spermatogenesis appears to progress unperturbed through meiosis. However, haploid cells undergo a complete arrest in spermatid development just prior to spermatid elongation. Arrested cells show altered Golgi apparatus organization, leading to a deficit in the generation of a spreading acrosomal cap from proacrosomal vesicles. Arrested cells ultimately merge to form giant multinucleated cells released to the epididymis. Spermatids also completely fail to form the flagellar axoneme. RNA-Seq analysis and ChIP-Seq analysis identified 139 genes directly controlled by RFX2 during spermiogenesis. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes required for cilium function are specifically enriched in down- and upregulated genes showing that RFX2 allows precise temporal expression of ciliary genes. Several genes required for cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling are also downregulated. Comparison of RFX2-regulated genes with those controlled by other major transcriptional regulators of spermiogenesis showed that each controls independent gene sets. Altogether, these observations show that RFX2 plays a major and specific function in spermiogenesis.},

Co-culture of PGCLCs with neonatal testicular somatic cells and sequential exposure to morphogens and sex hormones reproduced key hallmarks of meiosis, including erasure of genetic imprinting, chromosomal synapsis and recombination, and correct nuclear DNA and chromosomal content in the resulting haploid cells. Intracytoplasmic injection of the resulting spermatid-like cells into oocytes produced viable and fertile offspring, showing that this robust stepwise approach can functionally recapitulate male gametogenesis in vitro.

By analyzing a Tcr minigene in hemizygous transgenic mice, we show that Tcr gene products are post-meiotically expressed and are retained in the haploid sperm cells. The wild-type allele of Tcr, sperm motility kinase-1 (Smok1), behaves in the same manner, suggesting that Tcr/Smok reveal a common mechanism prone to evolve non-Mendelian inheritance in mammals.},

In both insects and mammals, however, all the cells derived from a single spermatogonial cell develop within a common syncytium formed as a result of incomplete cytokinesis at each of the mitotic and meiotic cell divisions1–3. It has been proposed that the intercellular bridges connecting the cells, which are about 1 μm in diameter4, permit the sharing of cytoplasmic constituents, thus ensuring the synchronous development of a clone of cells and gametic equivalence between haploid spermatids2,5,6. By analysing the product of a transgene which is expressed exclusively in post-meiotic germ cells in hemizygous transgenic mice, we have shown that genetically distinct spermatids share the product of the trans-gene and hence can be phenotypically equivalent.},

We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis with different choices of the resemblance function and different types of a single underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model. Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes alone may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions, with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves and even circles) may arise from very different data structures; therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by species totals, from the chi-square distance. We found that this function improves gradient recovery when there is unimodal species response and some species have their optima outside the range of study.},

A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by the polycomb silencing systems to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM2B (FBXL10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). This contributes to histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H2AK119ub1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM2B-PRC1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM2B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system. This provides the basis for a new model describing the functionality of CGIs as mammalian PREs. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00205.001},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:SYT-SSX is the oncogene associated with synovial sarcoma (SS), a stem cell disease. SYT-SSX is thought to be responsible for sarcoma initiation and development. It interacts with components of Polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes, the two epigenetic controllers that maintain the heritable status of differentiation-specific genes in the stem/progenitor cell. Through these associations SYT-SSX is thought to alter gene expression programs by epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, we reported that SYT-SSX2 reprograms mesenchymal stem cells and myoblasts by dictating their commitment to the neural lineage while disrupting their normal differentiation. This reprogramming was due to the direct occupancy of proneural genes by the SYT-SSX2 nuclear complex. To gain a clear understanding of SYT-SSX2 control of gene expression networks, we conducted a thorough genome-wide analysis to determine the mechanism of its recruitment and identify signature sets of epigenetic markers that would predict its targeting and transcriptional activity.RESULTS:SYT-SSX2 was recruited to distinct loci across all chromosomes, and an overwhelming number of Polycomb-modified sites enriched with the trimethylated histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) formed the main recruiting module for SYT-SSX2. Not all SYT-SSX2/H3K27me3-occupied genes had altered expression, denoting the requirement for additional signals upon oncogene binding. Differential binding and epigenetic patterns distinguished upregulated and downregulated genes. Most activated genes had SYT-SSX2 sites enriched with H3K27me3 within their body or near their transcription start site (TSS) whereas a majority of downregulated genes were characterized by SYT-SSX2/H3K27me3-rich regions at long-range, or by modifications associated with transcription activation within the gene body or near the TSS. Hierarchical and functional clustering identified H3K27me3 as the dominant epigenetic marker associated with SYT-SSX2 binding and gene expression. Notably, this analysis revealed a cluster of upregulated neuronal genes densely covered by H3K27me3, consistent with programming toward the neural lineage by SYT-SSX2 observed previously.CONCLUSIONS:The data analysis revealed that Polycomb complexes or their modified chromatin and their stably silenced differentiation programs seem to be the main target for SYT-SSX2, suggesting that their perturbation is at the center of tumorigenesis driven by the oncogene. Further research into this mechanism is crucial to the full understanding of SS biology.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates deregulation of polycomb activity by the synovial sarcoma-associated SYT-SSX2 oncogene, also known as SS18-SSX2. Synovial sarcoma is a soft tissue cancer associated with a recurrent t(X:18) translocation event that generates one of two fusion proteins, SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2. The role of the translocation products in this disease is poorly understood. We present evidence that the SYT-SSX2 fusion protein interacts with the polycomb repressive complex and modulates its gene silencing activity. SYT-SSX2 causes destabilization of the polycomb subunit Bmi1, resulting in impairment of polycomb-associated histone H2A ubiquitination and reactivation of polycomb target genes. Silencing by polycomb complexes plays a vital role in numerous physiological processes. In recent years, numerous reports have implicated gain of polycomb silencing function in several cancers. This study provides evidence that, in the appropriate context, expression of the SYT-SSX2 oncogene leads to loss of polycomb function. It challenges the notion that cancer is solely associated with an increase in polycomb function and suggests that any imbalance in polycomb activity could drive the cell toward oncogenesis. These findings provide a mechanism by which the SYT-SSX2 chimera may contribute to synovial sarcoma pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {In higher eukaryotes, up to 70\% of genes have high levels of nonmethylated cytosine/guanine base pairs (CpGs) surrounding promoters and gene regulatory units. These features, called CpG islands, were identified over 20 years ago, but there remains little mechanistic evidence to suggest how these enigmatic elements contribute to promoter function, except that they are refractory to epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Here we show that CpG islands directly recruit the H3K36-specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A. Nucleation of KDM2A at these elements results in removal of H3K36 methylation, creating CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of this modification. KDM2A utilizes a zinc finger CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain that preferentially recognizes nonmethylated CpG DNA, and binding is blocked when the CpG DNA is methylated, thus constraining KDM2A to nonmethylated CpG islands. These data expose a straightforward mechanism through which KDM2A delineates a unique architecture that differentiates CpG island chromatin from bulk chromatin.},

  abstract = {CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.},

In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P {$<$} 1 × 10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P {$<$} 5 × 10-8) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 × 10-10, odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases= 0.0059, MAFcontrols= 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 × 10-10, OR = 1.43, MAFcases= 0.011, MAFcontrols= 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 × 10-14, OR = 1.67, MAFcases= 0.0143, MAFcontrols= 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {The genetics of complex disease produce alterations in the molecular interactions of cellular pathways whose collective effect may become clear through the organized structure of molecular networks. To characterize molecular systems associated with late-onset Alzheimer?s disease (LOAD), we constructed gene-regulatory networks in 1,647 postmortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and nondemented subjects, and we demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have identified a number of significant risk loci, the majority of which lie in non-coding regions of the genome. The lack of causal alleles and considerable polygenicity remains a significant barrier to translation into mechanistic understanding. This includes identifying causal variants and the cell/tissue types in which they operate. A fuller understanding of the cell types and transcriptional networks involved in AD genetic risk mechanisms will provide important insights into pathogenesis. We assessed the significance of the overlap between genome-wide significant AD risk variants and sites of open chromatin from data sets representing diverse tissue types. We then focussed on macrophages and microglia to investigate the role of open chromatin sites containing motifs for specific transcription factors. Partitioned heritability using LDscore regression was used to investigate the contribution of specific macrophage and microglia transcription factor motif-containing open chromatin sites to the heritability of AD. AD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferentially located at sites of open chromatin in immune cells, particularly monocytes (z score = 4.43; corrected P = 5.88 × 10- 3). Similar enrichments are observed for macrophages (z score = 4.10; corrected P {$<$} 2.40 × 10- 3) and microglia (z score = 4.34, corrected P = 0.011). In both macrophages and microglia, AD risk variants are enriched at a subset of open chromatin sites that contain DNA binding motifs for specific transcription factors, e.g. SPI1 and MEF2. Genetic variation at many of these motif-containing sites also mediate a substantial proportion of AD heritability, with SPI1-containing sites capturing the majority of the common variant SNP-chip heritability (microglia enrichment = 16.28, corrected enrichment P = 0.0044). AD risk alleles plausibly operate in immune cells, including microglia, and are concentrated in specific transcriptional networks. Combined with primary genetic association results, the SPI1 and MEF2 transcriptional networks appear central to AD risk mechanisms. Investigation of transcription factors targeting AD risk SNP associated regulatory elements could provide powerful insights into the molecular processes affected by AD polygenic risk. More broadly, our findings support a model of polygenic disease risk that arises from variants located in specific transcriptional networks.},

  abstract = {Synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with cognitive decline. Involvement of microglia and complement in AD has been attributed to neuroinflammation, prominent late in disease. Here we show in mouse models that complement and microglia mediate synaptic loss early in AD. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before overt plaque deposition. Inhibition of C1q, C3, or the microglial complement receptor CR3 reduces the number of phagocytic microglia, as well as the extent of early synapse loss. C1q is necessary for the toxic effects of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers on synapses and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Finally, microglia in adult brains engulf synaptic material in a CR3-dependent process when exposed to soluble Aβ oligomers. Together, these findings suggest that the complement-dependent pathway and microglia that prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate synapse loss in AD.

Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic AÎ² particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Thet-haplotype, a mouse meiotic driver found on chromosome 17, has been a model for autosomal segregation distortion for close to a century, but several questions remain regarding its biology and evolutionary history. A recently published set of population genomics resources for wild mice includes several individuals heterozygous for thet-haplotype, which we use to characterize this selfish element at the genomic and transcriptomic level. Our results show that large sections of thet-haplotype have been replaced by standard homologous sequences, possibly due to occasional events of recombination, and that this complicates the inference of its history. As expected for a long genomic segment of very low recombination, thet-haplotype carries an excess of fixed nonsynonymous mutations compared to the standard chromosome. This excess is stronger for regions that have not undergone recent recombination, suggesting that occasional gene flow between thetand the standard chromosome may provide a mechanism to regenerate coding sequences that have accumulated deleterious mutations. Finally, we find thatt-complex genes with altered expression largely overlap with deleted or amplified regions, and that carrying at-haplotype alters the testis expression of genes outside of thet-complex, providing new leads into the pathways involved in the biology of this segregation distorter.

  abstract = {Most animals and many plants make use of specialized chromosomes (sex chromosomes) to determine an individual's sex. Best known are the XY and ZW sex-determination systems. Despite having evolved numerous times, sex chromosomes present something of an evolutionary puzzle. At their origin, alleles that dictate development as one sex or the other (primitive sex chromosomes) face a selective penalty, as they will be found more often in the more abundant sex. How is it possible that primitive sex chromosomes overcome this disadvantage? Any theory for the origin of sex chromosomes must identify the benefit that outweighs this cost and enables a sex-determining mutation to establish in the population. Here we show that a new sex-determining allele succeeds when linked to a sex-specific meiotic driver. The new sex-determining allele benefits from confining the driving allele to the sex in which it gains the benefit of drive. Our model requires few special assumptions and is sufficiently general to apply to the evolution of sex chromosomes in outbreeding cosexual or dioecious species. We highlight predictions of the model that can discriminate between this and previous theories of sex-chromosome origins.},

  abstract = {Transmission ratio distortion (TRD) occurs when one of the two alleles from either parent is preferentially transmitted to the offspring. This leads to a statistical departure from the Mendelian law of inheritance, which states that each of the two parental alleles is transmitted to offspring with a probability of 0.5. A number of mechanisms are thought to induce TRD such as meiotic drive, gametic competition, and embryo lethality. TRD has been extensively studied in animals, but the prevalence of TRD in humans remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, understanding the TRD phenomenon and taking it into consideration in many aspects of human genetics has potential benefits that have not been sufficiently emphasized in the current literature. In this review, we discuss the importance of TRD in three distinct but related fields of genetics: developmental genetics which studies the genetic abnormalities in zygotic and embryonic development, statistical genetics/genetic epidemiology which utilizes population study designs and statistical models to interpret the role of genes in human health, and population genetics which is concerned with genetic diversity in populations in an evolutionary context. From the perspective of developmental genetics, studying TRD leads to the identification of the processes and mechanisms for differential survival observed in embryos. As a result, it is a genetic force which affects allele frequency at the population, as well as, at the organismal level. Therefore, it has implications on genetic diversity of the population over time. From the perspective of genetic epidemiology, the TRD influence on a marker locus is a confounding factor which has to be adequately dealt with to correctly interpret linkage or association study results. These aspects are developed in this review. In addition to these theoretical notions, a brief summary of the empirical evidence of the TRD phenomenon in human and mouse studies is provided. The objective of our paper is to show the potentially important role of TRD in many areas of genetics, and to create an incentive for future research.},

If different species evolve distinct drive-suppressor systems, then hybrid progeny may be sterile as a result of negative interactions of these systems' components. Although the hypothesis that meiotic drive may contribute to hybrid sterility, and thus species formation, fell out of favour early in the 1990s, recent results showing an association between drive and sterility have resurrected this previously controversial idea. Here, we review the different forms of meiotic drive and their possible roles in speciation. We discuss the recent empirical evidence for a link between drive and hybrid male sterility, also suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for this link in the context of chromatin remodelling. Finally, we revisit the population genetics of drive that allow it to contribute to speciation.},

Owing to their transmission advantages, meiotic drivers can spread in populations even if the drivers or linked variants decrease organismal fitness. Meiotic drive was first formally described in the 1950s and is thought to be a powerful force shaping eukaryotic genomes. Classic genetic analyses have detected the action of meiotic drivers in plants, filamentous fungi, insects and vertebrates. Several of these drive systems have limited experimental tractability and relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of meiotic drive. Recently, however, meiotic drivers were discovered in a yeast species. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe wtf gene family contains several active meiotic drive genes. This review summarizes what is known about the wtf family and highlights its potential as a highly tractable experimental model for molecular and evolutionary characterization of meiotic drive. \textbackslash{}copyright 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {Mendel laws of inheritance can be cheated by Meiotic Drive Elements (MDs), complex nuclear genetic loci found in various eukaryotic genomes and distorting segregation in their favor. Here, we identify and characterize in the model fungus Podospora anserina Spok1 and Spok2, two MDs known as Spore Killers. We show that they are related genes with both spore-killing distorter and spore-protecting responder activities carried out by the same allele. These alleles act as autonomous elements, exert their effects independently of their location in the genome and can act as MDs in other fungi. Additionally, Spok1 acts as a resistance factor to Spok2 killing. Genetical data and cytological analysis of Spok1 and Spok2 localization during the killing process suggest a complex mode of action for Spok proteins. Spok1 and Spok2 belong to a multigene family prevalent in the genomes of many ascomycetes. As they have no obvious cellular role, Spok1 and Spok2 Spore Killer genes represent a novel kind of selfish genetic elements prevalent in fungal genome that proliferate through meiotic distortion. Chromosome segregation during meiosis ensures that paternal and maternal chromosomes are equally transmitted to the progeny. Meiotic Drive Elements (MDs) are known to distort this 1∶1 ratio in many animal, plant, and fungal species by killing the gametes not carrying them. Most of the known MDs are complex genetic loci with separate genes for the killing activity and the resistance to said killing. Here, we report in a model fungus on two genes endowed with MD properties previously unreported. Both genes produce a single polypeptide and confer both killing and resistance. They exert their effect irrespective of their position in the genome. They can cross species barriers and promote bias in segregation in other species. As related genes are frequently observed in fungal genomes, we propose that they are representative of a novel kind of selfish genes that propagate by distorting the Mendel laws of segregation.},

  abstract = {Segregation Distorter (SD) is an autosomal meiotic drive gene complex found worldwide in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. During spermatogenesis, SD induces dysfunction of SD+ spermatids so that SD/SD+ males sire almost exclusively SD-bearing progeny rather than the expected 1:1 Mendelian ratio. SD is thus evolutionarily ” selfish,” enhancing its own transmission at the expense of its bearers. Here we review the molecular and evolutionary genetics of SD. Genetic analyses show that the SD is a multilocus gene complex involving two key loci—the driver, Segregation distorter (Sd), and the target of drive, Responder (Rsp)—and at least three upward modifiers of distortion. Molecular analyses show that Sd encodes a truncated duplication of the gene RanGAP, whereas Rsp is a large pericentromeric block of satellite DNA. The Sd–RanGAP protein is enzymatically wild type but mislocalized within cells and, for reasons that remain unclear, appears to disrupt the histone-to-protamine transition in drive-sensitive spermatids bearing many Rsp satellite repeats but not drive-insensitive spermatids bearing few or no Rsp satellite repeats. Evolutionary analyses show that the Sd–RanGAP duplication arose recently within the D. melanogaster lineage, exploiting the preexisting and considerably older Rsp satellite locus. Once established, the SD haplotype collected enhancers of distortion and suppressors of recombination. Further dissection of the molecular genetic and cellular basis of SD-mediated distortion seems likely to provide insights into several important areas currently understudied, including the genetic control of spermatogenesis, the maintenance and evolution of satellite DNAs, the possible roles of small interfering RNAs in the germline, and the molecular population genetics of the interaction of genetic linkage and natural selection.},

  abstract = {In most mammals, the testes provide a stable environment for spermatogenesis, which depends on a lower temperature than the core body temperature. It has been reported that mild testicular heating safely and reversibly suppresses spermatogenesis, and is under consideration for its potential application as a male contraceptive. Previously, we focused on the molecular mechanism of germ cell apoptosis and anti-apoptotic factors induced by heat treatment in humans and mice. However, the recovery process remains under investigation. In this study, we found that lipid droplets in mouse testes are dramatically increased after a brief period of scrotal hyperthermia, and gradually dissipate following temperature normalization. Analysis of the human testis proteome revealed nine proteins associated with lipid droplets. Two of them, ADFP (also known as ADRP and PLIN2) and TIP47 (also known as PLIN3) may participate in acute lipid droplet formation in mammalian testes. We show that Adfp expression is upregulated after scrotal heat treatment in mice. Surprisingly, we find Adfp lacking its 5′-UTR is observed in AdfpΔ1/Δ1 mouse testes, but is not detectable in liver. These results reveal testis Adfp transcriptional regulation is tissue-specific, and is associated with lipid droplet accumulation induced by heat. The results also indicate that the testes could retain functional proteins through testes-specific transcriptional regulation.},

A retrotransposon sequence within a noncoding RNA spanning the DMR was targeted by piRNAs generated from a different locus. A direct repeat in the DMR, which is required for the methylation and imprinting of Rasgrf1, served as a promoter for this RNA. We propose a model in which piRNAs and a target RNA direct the sequence-specific methylation of Rasgrf1.},

Here we report the cytological characterization of piRNAs in the adult mouse testis and the phenotypic analysis of Miwi(-/-); Mili(-/-) mice. We show that piRNAs are specifically present in germ cells, especially abundant in spermatocytes and early round spermatids, regardless of the type of the genomic sequences to which they correspond. piRNAs and PIWI proteins are present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the cytoplasm, they are enriched in the chromatoid body; whereas in the nucleus they are enriched in the dense body, a male-specific organelle associated with synapsis and the formation of the XY body during meiosis. Moreover, by generating Miwi(-/-); Mili(-/-) mice, which lack all PIWI proteins in the adult, we show that PIWI proteins and presumably piRNAs in the adult are required only for spermatogenesis. Spermatocytes without PIWI proteins are arrested at the pachytene stage, when the sex chromosomes undergo transcriptional silencing to form the XY body. These results pinpoint a function of the PIWI protein subfamily to meiosis during spermatogenesis. Copyright \textbackslash{}copyright 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {During the development of mammalian embryonic germ cells, global demethylation and de novo DNA methylation take place. In mouse embryonic germ cells, two PIWI family proteins, MILI and MIWI2, are essential for the de novo DNA methylation of retrotransposons, presumably through PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Although piRNA-associated MIWI2 has been reported to play critical roles in the process, its molecular mechanisms have remained unclear. To identify the mechanism, transgenic mice were produced; they contained a fusion protein of MIWI2 and a zinc finger (ZF) that recognized the promoter region of a type A LINE-1 gene. The ZF-MIWI2 fusion protein brought about DNA methylation, suppression of the type A LINE-1 gene, and a partial rescue of the impaired spermatogenesis of MILI-null mice. In addition, ZF-MIWI2 was associated with the proteins involved in DNA methylation. These data indicate that MIWI2 functions as an effector of de novo DNA methylation of the retrotransposon.

  abstract = {Germ cells express a unique subset of genes called germ genes mostly encoding RNA-binding proteins such as Dazl, Dnd and Vasa. How germ gene expression is controlled remains illusive, because in no organism has a transcription factor been identified that regulate expression of these genes. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) has been reported to show expression in male mouse germ cells of the adult testis. Here we report in the fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) that Mitf is a transcription activator of germ gene expression. Mitf is a master regulator of melanocyte development, which activates melanogenic genes through binding to the E-box containing consensus CANNTG. The E-box was found to be present in 23∼26 copies in the promoters of medaka germ genes dazl, dnd and vasa. Importantly, forced Mitf expression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the three gene promoters by up to more than 10 fold and remarkably increased the level of endogenous dazl, dnd and vasa transcripts in cell culture. Transfection of Mitf expression vectors was sufficient to induce directed differentiation of medaka embryonic stem cells into melanocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the expression of both medaka mitf genes in adult germ cells of male and female gonads. Mitf is well-known as the melanocyte master regulator. Our results offer first evidence that Mitf may act as a transcriptional activator of germ gene expression in medaka.},

  abstract = {Background: The proto-oncogene MYC encodes a bHLHLZ transcription factor that binds to its obligate DNA-binding partner, MAX, leading to heterodimer occupancy of E-Box motifs within the genome. MYC is normally mitogen-dependent and tightly regulated where it plays a role in transcriptionally coordinating metabolic sufficiency for cell cycle progression, regulating both proliferation and viability. MYC is deregulated in the majority of human cancers. Importantly, MYC exists within an extended family of related bHLHLZ transcription factors including the MYC antagonizing MAX dimerization (MXD) proteins, MYC paralogs, such as MYCN, as well as MAX-like protein X (MLX), and its nutrient-sensing heterodimerization partners MondoA and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). We recently defined a role for the extended MAX/MLX network in the regulation of metabolism and survival of cancer cells specifically with deregulated MYC or MYCN, in which MYC-MAX or MYCN-MAX heterodimers coordinately regulate transcription of important metabolic targets with MondoA-MLX to facilitate tumor cell survival. Targeting a number of these downstream effectors is sufficient to kill cancer cells with deregulated MYC.

Methods: Expanding on our initial findings we have used molecular and biochemical approaches to demonstrate non-redundant roles for both MondoA-MLX and ChREBP-MLX in the transcriptional regulation of metabolism and survival of human cancer cells with deregulated MYC, including liver and colon cancer cells. We have also characterized the metabolic and biological phenotypes associated with targeted deletion of Mlx in the mouse, combining in vivo and ex vivo analysis with both whole-body deletion and tissue-specific ablation to unmask novel functions of Mlx and its binding partners.

Results: Our results demonstrate that MLX and its binding partners regulate pathways associated with mitochondrial function as well as glucose and lipid metabolism in a non-redundant, cell-type-dependent manner. The presence of MLX stabilizes MondoA and ChREBP, and deletion of Mlx in the mouse leads to decreased levels of MondoA and Chrebp proteins in vivo. Whole-body deletion of Mlx in the mouse is well tolerated but leads to male infertility and teratozoospermia. This sterility phenotype is recapitulated by specific deletion of Mlx in the Sertoli cells of the testis, a major metabolic cell type within the tissue and the central regulator of multiple steps associated with germ cell fate, including production and/or transport of critical metabolites required by the germ cells. This indicates both cell-autonomous (germ cell) and non-cell-autonomous (Sertoli cell) regulation of survival and metabolism in spermatogenesis mediated by Mlx. Importantly, human patients with teratozoospermia exhibit diminished expression of MondoA, MLX and their metabolic targets. Moreover, overexpression of MYCN, MondoA, MLX and their metabolic targets occurs in patients with germ cell-derived tumors, such as seminomas.

Conclusions: Transcriptional coordination between the mitogen- and nutrient-responsive arms of the MAX/MLX network exhibits context-dependent lethality. MondoA and Chrebp exhibit non-redundant functions in both cancer cells and normal mouse tissue, and inactivation of Mlx phenocopies loss of both factors, suggesting that targeting Mlx can inhibit both MondoA and Chrebp transcriptional activity and subsequent metabolic output. Metabolic regulation by Mlx impacts normal testicular tissue homeostasis and differentiation in the mouse, and its deregulation is associated with human diseases such as loss of function associated with infertility and gain of function associated with germ cell malignancy. While deletion of Myc, Mycn or Max is embryonic lethal in the mouse, deletion of MondoA, Chrebp or Mlx is well tolerated, indicating that targeting this arm of the extended MYC network, or their critical downstream targets, could be of therapeutic value in metabolic syndrome, fertility and cancer.

  abstract = {ETV5 (Ets variant gene 5) is a transcription factor that is required for fertility. In this study, we demonstrate that ETV5 plays additional roles in embryonic and postnatal developmental processes in the mouse. Through a genome-wide mouse mutagenesis approach, we generated a sterile mouse line that carried a nonsense mutation in exon 12 of the Etv5 gene. The mutation led to the conversion of lysine at position 412 into a premature termination codon (PTC) within the ETS DNA binding domain of the protein. We showed that the PTC-containing allele produced a highly unstable mRNA, which in turn resulted in an undetectable level of ETV5 protein. The Etv5 mutation resulted in male and female sterility as determined by breeding experiments. Mutant males were sterile due to a progressive loss of spermatogonia, which ultimately resulted in a Sertoli cell only phenotype by 8 week-of-age. Further, the ETV5 target genes Cxcr4 and Ccl9 were significantly down-regulated in mutant neonate testes. CXCR4 and CCL9 have been implicated in the maintenance and migration of spermatogonia, respectively. Moreover, the Etv5 mutation resulted in several developmental abnormalities including an increased incidence of embryonic and perinatal lethality, postnatal growth restriction, polydactyly and renal asymmetry. Thus, our data define a physiological role for ETV5 in many aspects of development including embryonic and perinatal survival, postnatal growth, limb patterning, kidney development and fertility.},

To study the function of the murine Rex1 gene in vivo, we have used cre/lox technology to create Rex1(floxed) mice and mice deficient in Rex1 gene function. Rex1−/−males are characterized by an age-associated decrease in sperm counts, abnormal sperm morphology, and mild testicular atrophy. We characterized global patterns of gene expression in primary germ cells by microarray and identified the growth hormone responsive gene, GRTP1, as a transcript present at a 4.5 fold higher level in wild type (WT) compared to Rex1−/− mice. We analyzed immature germ cell (Dazl), proliferating (PCNA), and Sertoli cell populations, and quantitated levels of apoptosis in Rex1−/− as compared to WT testes. We evaluated the expression of proteins previously reported to correlate with Rex1 expression, such as STAT3, phospho-STAT3, p38, and phospho-p38 in the testis. We report a distinct cellular localization of total STAT3 protein in Rex1−/− affected testes. Our data suggest that loss of Rex1 leads to impaired testicular function.},

  abstract = {The progression of spermatogenesis involves global changes in chromatin structure and conformation. However, our understanding of the regulation of chromatin changes in germ cells remains limited. Here we describe both in vivo RNA interference and genetic mouse knockout studies that identify a critical role for Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in mammalian spermatogenesis. In the YY1-deficient spermatocytes, we find a significant decrease in the global level of the heterochromatin markers (H3K9me3 and HP1-gamma) and a concomitant increase in the double-strand break (DSB) signals on chromosomes (gamma-H2AX, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, and Rad51) at the leptotene/zygotene stages of spermatocytes. These findings support a link between chromatin modifications and meiotic DSB formation, as has been seen in other model organisms. We propose that a depletion of YY1 may alter the structural integrity of heterochromatin, rendering it more accessible to the DSB machinery. In addition, YY1-deficient spermatocytes show univalent formation, increased aneuploidy, and pachytene cell death, which are likely due to defects in DNA repair. Taken together, this study identifies an important role for YY1 in mouse meiosis and provides new insight into mechanisms that regulate mammalian spermatogenesis.},

In the current study, we characterized the in vivo roles of Rex1 using a mutant mouse line disrupting its transcription. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of YY1, Rex1 is expressed only during spermatogenesis and early embryogenesis and also in a very limited area of the placenta. Yet, the gene dosage of Rex1 is very critical for the survival of the late-stage embryos and neonates. This delayed phenotypic consequence suggests potential roles for Rex1 in establishing and maintaining unknown epigenetic modifications. Consistently, Rex1-null blastocysts display hypermethylation in the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of Peg3 and Gnas imprinted domains, which are known to contain YY1 binding sites. Further analyses confirmed in vivo binding of Rex1 only to the unmethylated allele of these two regions. Thus, Rex1 may function as a protector for these DMRs against DNA methylation. Overall, the functional connection of Rex1 to genomic imprinting represents another case where newly made genes have co-evolved with lineage-specific phenomena.},

We have previously shown that in erythroid cells there is a regulatory hierarchy within the KLF family, whereby KLF1 drives the expression of both the Klf3 and Klf8 genes and KLF3 in turn represses Klf8 expression. While the erythroid roles of KLF1 and KLF3 have been explored, the contribution of KLF8 to this regulatory network has been unknown. To investigate this, we have generated a mouse model with disrupted KLF8 expression. While these mice are viable, albeit with a reduced life span, mice lacking both KLF3 and KLF8 die at around embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), indicative of a genetic interaction between these two factors. In the fetal liver, Klf3 Klf8 double mutant embryos exhibit greater dysregulation of gene expression than either of the two single mutants. In particular, we observe derepression of embryonic, but not adult, globin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that KLF3 and KLF8 have overlapping roles in vivo and participate in the silencing of embryonic globin expression during development.},

  abstract = {Abstract Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local ?bump? is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its presence.},

  abstract = {Piwi-interacting RNAs are a diverse class of small non-coding RNAs implicated in the silencing of transposable elements and the safeguarding of genome integrity. In mammals, male germ cells express two genetically and developmentally distinct populations of piRNAs at the pre-pachytene and pachytene stages of meiosis, respectively. Pre-pachytene piRNAs are mostly derived from retrotransposons and required for their silencing. In contrast, pachytene piRNAs originate from ∼3,000 genomic clusters, and their biogenesis and function remain enigmatic. Here, we report that conditional inactivation of the putative RNA helicase MOV10L1 in mouse spermatocytes produces a specific loss of pachytene piRNAs, significant accumulation of pachytene piRNA precursor transcripts, and unusual polar conglomeration of Piwi proteins with mitochondria. Pachytene piRNA–deficient spermatocytes progress through meiosis without derepression of LINE1 retrotransposons, but become arrested at the post-meiotic round spermatid stage with massive DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that MOV10L1 acts upstream of Piwi proteins in the primary processing of pachytene piRNAs and suggest that, distinct from pre-pachytene piRNAs, pachytene piRNAs fulfill a unique function in maintaining post-meiotic genome integrity. Small non-coding RNAs play critical roles during development and in disease. The integrity of the germline genome is of paramount importance to the wellbeing of offspring and the survival of species. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs abundantly expressed in the gonad. Compared to microRNAs and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the biogenesis and function of piRNAs remain poorly understood. Here we have identified MOV10L1, a putative RNA helicase, as a master regulator of piRNA biogenesis in mouse. We find that production of pachytene piRNAs requires MOV10L1. Blockade of pachytene piRNAs disrupts germ cell development and results in defects in post-meiotic genome integrity. Therefore, mutations in MOV10L1 and other piRNA pathway components may contribute to male infertility in humans.},

However, over 20,000 unique species of piRNAs mapped to the human genome are more than the relatively few presumably required to regulate the known human transposon classes. Here, we present the results of the first genome-wide effort to study the effects of piRNAs on gene specific DNA methylation. We found that exon-derived piRNAs consist almost universally of species with 10 or fewer genomic copies, whereas piRNAs existing in high copies originate predominately from intronic and intergenic regions. Genome-wide methylation profiling following transfection of human somatic cells with piRNA mimics revealed methylation changes at numerous genic loci in single copy piRNA-transfected cells. Moreover, genomic regions directly adjacent to differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched for sequence matches to the transfected piRNAs. These findings suggest that a subset of single copy piRNAs may be able to induce DNA methylation at non-TE genic loci, a process that may be mediated in part by direct binding to either genomic DNA or nascent mRNA near target CpG sites.},

  abstract = {The microrchidia (MORC) family proteins are chromatin-remodelling factors and function in diverse biological processes such as DNA damage response and transposon silencing. Here, we report that mouse Morc2b encodes a functional germ cell-specific member of the MORC protein family. Morc2b arose specifically in the rodent lineage through retrotransposition of Morc2a during evolution. Inactivation of Morc2b leads to meiotic arrest and sterility in both sexes. Morc2b-deficient spermatocytes and oocytes exhibit failures in chromosomal synapsis, blockades in meiotic recombination, and increased apoptosis. Loss of MORC2B causes mis-regulated expression of meiosis-specific genes. Furthermore, we find that MORC2B interacts with MORC2A, its sequence paralogue. Our results demonstrate that Morc2b, a relatively recent gene, has evolved an essential role in meiosis and fertility. In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis, a process unique to germ cells, produces haploid gametes. Abnormalities in meiosis can lead to infertility, loss of pregnancy, or genetic diseases such as Down syndrome. The meiotic processes are tightly regulated by a large number of genes including many meiosis-specific ones. The majority of meiosis-specific factors are conserved, however, species-specific factors have evolved. Here we report functional studies of a rodent lineage–specific gene named Morc2b. Morc2b belongs to a family of chromatin-remodelling factors. Morc2b is specifically expressed in germ cells. Disruption of Morc2b causes meiotic arrest and infertility in both sexes. Notably, MORC2B regulates the expression of a number of meiosis-specific genes. Interestingly, MORC2B interacts with its sequence homologue MORC2A. These functional studies have uncovered a new protein complex in the regulation of key meiotic processes and suggested the presence of continued selection pressure for evolution of new meiosis-specific factors.},

  abstract = {Miwi, a member of the Argonaute family, is required for initiating spermiogenesis; however, the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the Miwi gene remain unknown. By mutation analysis and transgenic models, we identified a 303 bp proximal promoter region of the mouse Miwi gene, which controls specific expression from midpachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids during meiosis. We characterized the binding sites of transcription factors NF-Y (Nuclear Factor Y) and USF (Upstream Stimulatory Factor) within the core promoter and found that both factors specifically bind to and activate the Miwi promoter. Methylation profiling of three CpG islands within the proximal promoter reveals a markedly inverse correlation between the methylation status of the CpG islands and germ cell type–specific expression of Miwi. CpG methylation at the USF–binding site within the E2 box in the promoter inhibits the binding of USF. Transgenic Miwi-EGFP and endogenous Miwi reveal a subcellular co-localization pattern in the germ cells of the Miwi-EGFP transgenic mouse. Furthermore, the DNA methylation profile of the Miwi promoter–driven transgene is consistent with that of the endogenous Miwi promoter, indicating that Miwi transgene is epigenetically modified through methylation in vivo to ensure its spatio-temporal expression. Our findings suggest that USF controls Miwi expression from midpachytene spermatocytes to round spermatids through methylation-mediated regulation. This work identifies an epigenetic regulation mechanism for the spatio-temporal expression of mouse Miwi during spermatogenesis. Germ cell differentiation is a key process in the formation of functional spermatozoa. Despite the wealth of information about gene expression patterns and regulations important for this process, it is not clear how spatio-temporal expression of the key factor Miwi during spermatogenesis is controlled. We have characterized the functional promoter of the mouse Miwi gene. Transgenic mice harboring EGFP under the Miwi core promoter containing just the functional CCAAT box and E2 box were generated and demonstrated that it can direct germ cell–specific expression. We further identified the transcription factors NF-Y and USF1/2 as activators of Miwi gene expression, through their binding to the CCAAT box and E-box/E2 site of the Miwi promoter, respectively. A CpG dinucleotide just located within the USF binding site is responsible for mediating methylation-dependent silencing of the Miwi gene. Our findings provide new insight into an epigenetic regulation mechanism for the spatio-temporal expression of the mouse Miwi during spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {piRNAs are critical for transposable element (TE) repression and germ cell survival during the early phases of spermatogenesis, however, their role in adult germ cells and the relative importance of piRNA methylation is poorly defined in mammals. Using a mouse model of HEN methyltransferase 1 (HENMT1) loss-of-function, RNA-Seq and a range of RNA assays we show that HENMT1 is required for the 2' O-methylation of mammalian piRNAs. HENMT1 loss leads to piRNA instability, reduced piRNA bulk and length, and ultimately male sterility characterized by a germ cell arrest at the elongating germ cell phase of spermatogenesis. HENMT1 loss-of-function, and the concomitant loss of piRNAs, resulted in TE de-repression in adult meiotic and haploid germ cells, and the precocious, and selective, expression of many haploid-transcripts in meiotic cells. Precocious expression was associated with a more active chromatin state in meiotic cells, elevated levels of DNA damage and a catastrophic deregulation of the haploid germ cell gene expression. Collectively these results define a critical role for HENMT1 and piRNAs in the maintenance of TE repression in adult germ cells and setting the spermatogenic program. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs found in great abundance within both embryonic and adult male germ cells. Within embryonic germ cells, piRNAs have a well-recognized role in transposable element (TE) silencing, however, their role in adult cells remains poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that HENMT1 dysfunction and the resultant piRNA instability dramatically impacts multiple aspects of adult germ cell biology. Specifically, pachytene piRNAs are required to maintain TE silencing in adult germ cells and to set the spermatogenic gene expression program. piRNA loss leads to a more active chromatin state in the regulatory regions of numerous normally haploid germ cell genes and their precocious expression during meiosis, followed by a catastrophic deregulation of gene expression in haploid cells and male sterility.},

  abstract = {In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To examine whether the piRNA pathway can be used to silence genes of interest in germ cells, we have generated knock-in mice in which a foreign DNA fragment was inserted into a region generating pachytene piRNAs. The knock-in sequence was transcribed, and the resulting RNA was processed to yield piRNAs in postnatal testes. When reporter genes possessing a sequence complementary to portions of the knock-in sequence were introduced, they were greatly repressed after the time of pachytene piRNA generation. This repression mainly occurred at the post-transcriptional level, as degradation of the reporter RNAs was accelerated. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.},

Here, we report the involvement of pachytene piRNAs in instructing massive mRNA elimination in mouse elongating spermatids (ES). We demonstrate that a piRNA-induced silencing complex (pi-RISC) containing murine PIWI (MIWI) and deadenylase CAF1 is selectively assembled in ES, which is responsible for inducing mRNA deadenylation and decay via a mechanism that resembles the action of miRNAs in somatic cells. Such a highly orchestrated program appears to take full advantage of the enormous repertoire of diversified targeting capacity of pachytene piRNAs derived from nontransposon intergenic regions. These findings suggest that pachytene piRNAs are responsible for inactivating vast cellular programs in preparation for sperm production from ES.},

Spermatogenesis in the MILI-null mice was blocked completely at the early prophase of the first meiosis, from the zygotene to early pachytene, and the mice were sterile. However, primordial germ cell development and female germ cell production were not disturbed. Furthermore, MILI bound to MVH, which is an essential factor during the early spermatocyte stage. The similarities in the phenotypes of the MILI- and MVH-deficient mice and in the physical binding properties of MILI and MVH indicate a functional association of these proteins in post-transcriptional regulation.

Mammalian transposon-silencing piRNAs accumulate early in spermatogenesis, whereas pachytene piRNAs are produced later during postnatal spermatogenesis and account for {$>$}95\% of all piRNAs in the adult mouse testis. Mutants defective for pachytene piRNA pathway proteins fail to produce mature sperm, but neither the piRNA precursor transcripts nor the trigger for pachytene piRNA production is known. Here, we show that the transcription factor A-MYB initiates pachytene piRNA production. A-MYB drives transcription of both pachytene piRNA precursor RNAs and the mRNAs for core piRNA biogenesis factors including MIWI, the protein through which pachytene piRNAs function. A-MYB regulation of piRNA pathway proteins and piRNA genes creates a coherent feedforward loop that ensures the robust accumulation of pachytene piRNAs.

  abstract = {With the advent of quantitative tools for measuring gene expression in single cells, researchers have made the discovery that in many contexts, messenger RNA and protein levels can vary widely from cell to cell, often because of inherently stochastic events associated with gene expression. The study of this cellular individuality has become a field of study in its own right, characterized by a blend of technological development, theoretical analysis, and, more recently, applications to biological phenomena. In this review, we focus on the use of the variability inherent to gene expression as a tool to understand gene regulation. We discuss the use of variability as a natural systems-level perturbation, its use in quantitatively characterizing the biological processes underlying transcription, and its application to the discovery of new gene regulatory interactions. We believe that use of variability can provide new biological insights into different aspects of transcriptional control and can provide a powerful complementary approach to that of existing techniques.

  abstract = {We describe a computational protocol for the ARACNE algorithm, an information-theoretic method for identifying transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray expression profile data. Similar to other algorithms, ARACNE predicts potential functional associations among genes, or novel functions for uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between gene products. However, based on biochemical validation, literature searches and DNA binding site enrichment analysis, ARACNE has also proven effective in identifying bona fide transcriptional targets, even in complex mammalian networks. Thus we envision that predictions made by ARACNE, especially when supplemented with prior knowledge or additional data sources, can provide appropriate hypotheses for the further investigation of cellular networks. While the examples in this protocol use only gene expression profile data, the algorithm's theoretical basis readily extends to a variety of other high-throughput measurements, such as pathway-specific or genome-wide proteomics, microRNA and metabolomics data. As these data become readily available, we expect that ARACNE might prove increasingly useful in elucidating the underlying interaction models. For a microarray data set containing 10,000 probes, reconstructing the network around a single probe completes in several minutes using a desktop computer with a Pentium 4 processor. Reconstructing a genome-wide network generally requires a computational cluster, especially if the recommended bootstrapping procedure is used.},

  abstract = {Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org. Gene regulatory networks control developmental, homeostatic, and disease processes by governing precise levels and spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression. Determining their topology can provide mechanistic insight into these processes. Gene regulatory networks consist of interactions between transcription factors and their direct target genes. Each regulatory interaction represents the binding of the transcription factor to a specific DNA binding site near its target gene. Here we present a computational method, called iRegulon, to identify master regulators and direct target genes in a human gene signature, i.e. a set of co-expressed genes. iRegulon relies on the analysis of the regulatory sequences around each gene in the gene set to detect enriched TF motifs or ChIP-seq peaks, using databases of nearly 10.000 TF motifs and 1000 ChIP-seq data sets or ” tracks”. Next, it associates enriched motifs and tracks with candidate transcription factors and determines the optimal subset of direct target genes. We validate iRegulon on ENCODE data, and use it in combination with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to map a p53 downstream network with new predicted co-factors and targets. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin, supporting human, mouse, and Drosophila genes, and provides access to hundreds of cancer-related TF-target subnetworks or ” regulons”.},

  abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

  abstract = {Highly multiplexed single-molecule FISH has emerged as a promising approach to spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics because of its ability to directly image and profile numerous RNA species in their native cellular context. However, background-from off-target binding of FISH probes and cellular autofluorescence-can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the degree of multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for FISH measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH probes to cellular components other than RNA, such as proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored RNAs to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH). We observed a reduction both in the background because of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an improved detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH, and an increased measurement throughput via extension of MERFISH into four color channels. We further demonstrated MERFISH measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We envision that this method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both cell culture and tissues.},

Whereas comparable expression patterns of the Venus reporter were found in somatic tissues, preliminary studies suggested that a striking difference in reporter expression may exist in mature spermatozoa of these species. Here we clearly show the differential expression of Venus reporter protein during spermatogenesis of the two compared species, the laboratory rabbit and mice. We provide evidence for the functionality of intercellular bridges in the male germline and genotype-independent transgenic phenotype of rabbit spermatids.

However, RA acts too widely in mammalian development to account, by itself, for the cell-type and temporal specificity of meiotic initiation. We considered parallels to yeast, in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors combine to restrict meiotic initiation. We demonstrate that, in mouse embryos, extrinsic and intrinsic factors together regulate meiotic initiation. The mouse RNA-binding protein DAZL, which is expressed by postmigratory germ cells, is a key intrinsic factor, enabling those cells to initiate meiosis in response to RA. Within a brief developmental window, Dazl-expressing germ cells in both XX and XY embryos actively acquire the ability to interpret RA as a meiosis-inducing signal.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis between homologous chromosomes are essential for proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division. While recombination and synapsis, as well as checkpoints that monitor these two events, take place in the context of a prophase I-specific axial chromosome structure, it remains unclear how chromosome axis components contribute to these processes. We show here that many protein components of the meiotic chromosome axis, including SYCP2, SYCP3, HORMAD1, HORMAD2, SMC3, STAG3, and REC8, become post-translationally modified by phosphorylation during the prophase I stage. We found that HORMAD1 and SMC3 are phosphorylated at a consensus site for the ATM/ATR checkpoint kinase and that the phosphorylated forms of HORMAD1 and SMC3 localize preferentially to unsynapsed chromosomal regions where synapsis has not yet occurred, but not to synapsed or desynapsed regions. We investigated the genetic requirements for the phosphorylation events and revealed that the phosphorylation levels of HORMAD1, HORMAD2, and SMC3 are dramatically reduced in the absence of initiation of meiotic recombination, whereas BRCA1 and SYCP3 are required for normal levels of phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, but not of SMC3. Interestingly, reduced HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 phosphorylation is associated with impaired targeting of the MSUC (meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin) machinery to unsynapsed chromosomes, suggesting that these post-translational events contribute to the regulation of the synapsis surveillance system. We propose that modifications of chromosome axis components serve as signals that facilitate chromosomal events including recombination, checkpoint control, transcription, and synapsis regulation. Meiosis is a specialized cell division to generate haploid sperm and eggs. For accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division, chromosome synapsis and recombination should be properly established between them during the prophase I stage. Chromosome synapsis and recombination proceed in the context of the meiotic chromosome axis. While studies using knockout mouse models have revealed that chromosome axis components play roles in multiple chromosomal events during mammalian meiosis, it remains to be elucidated how they contribute to the processes. Here, we show that many mammalian meiotic chromosome axis proteins are phosphorylated in a spatially and temporally distinct manner during the prophase I stage. Especially, phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and SMC3 was observed preferentially in chromosomal regions where synapsis has not occurred. Moreover, phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 was reduced in mutant testicular cells that were defective in recombination initiation or chromosome axis organization. Additionally, the mutant spermatocytes failed to correctly distribute checkpoint proteins that coordinate chromosome synapsis with gene expression and meiotic progression. Thus, it is suggested that phosphorylation of chromosome axis proteins serves as integrative axis marks for the status of events that take place on meiotic chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements and their fossil sequences occupy about half of the genome in mammals. While most of these selfish mobile elements have been inactivated by truncations and mutations during evolution, some copies remain competent to transpose and/or amplify, posing an ongoing genetic threat. To control such mutagenic sequences, host genomes have developed multiple layers of defence mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation and RNA silencing. Germ cells, in particular, employ the piwi–small RNA pathway, which plays a central and adaptive role in safeguarding the germline genome from retrotransposons. Recent studies have revealed that a class of developmentally regulated genes, which have long been implicated in germ cell specification and differentiation, such as vasa and tudor family genes, play key roles in the piwi pathway to suppress retrotransposons, indicating that the piwi-mediated genome protection is at the core of germline development. Furthermore, while the piwi system primarily operates post-transcriptionally at the RNA level, it also affects the epigenetics of cognate genome loci, offering an intriguing link between small RNAs and transcriptional control in mammals. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the piwi pathway in mice, which is emerging as a fundamental component of spermatogenesis that ensures male fertility and genome integrity.},

  abstract = {As genetic information is transmitted through successive generations, it passes between pluripotent cells in the early embryo and germ cells in the developing foetus and adult animal. Tex19.1 encodes a protein of unknown function, whose expression is restricted to germ cells and pluripotent cells. During male spermatogenesis, Tex19.1 expression is highest in mitotic spermatogonia and diminishes as these cells differentiate and progress through meiosis. In pluripotent stem cells, Tex19.1 expression is also downregulated upon differentiation. However, it is not clear whether Tex19.1 has an essential function in germ cells or pluripotent stem cells, or what that function might be. To analyse the potential role of Tex19.1 in pluripotency or germ cell function we have generated Tex19.1−/− knockout mice and analysed the Tex19.1−/− mutant phenotype. Adult Tex19.1−/− knockout males exhibit impaired spermatogenesis. Immunostaining and histological analysis revealed defects in meiotic chromosome synapsis, the persistence of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis, and a loss of post-meiotic germ cells in the testis. Furthermore, expression of a class of endogenous retroviruses is upregulated during meiosis in the Tex19.1−/− testes. Increased transposition of endogenous retroviruses in the germline of Tex19.1−/− mutant mice, and the concomitant increase in DNA damage, may be sufficient to disrupt the normal processes of recombination and chromosome synapsis during meiosis and cause defects in spermatogenesis. Our results suggest that Tex19.1 is part of a specialised mechanism that operates in the germline to repress transposable genetic elements and maintain genomic stability through successive generations. The germ cells—eggs in females and sperm in males—are responsible for passing genetic information from one generation to the next. As any genetic changes that arise in the germ cells can be transmitted to the next generation, germ cells are a prime target for the activity of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements make up around 40\% of a mammalian genome, and many of these elements are derived from retroviruses that have infected germ cells, or early embryonic precursors to germ cells, and have integrated into the genome. Here, we characterise the function of Tex19.1, a gene whose expression is restricted to germ cells and the pluripotent cells that are early embryonic precursors to germ cells. We show that when Tex19.1 is deleted from mice, germ cells have problems progressing through meiosis, and sperm production is impaired. Furthermore, we show that, in the absence of Tex19.1, endogenous retroviruses are activated in male germ cells attempting to go through meiosis. Our results suggest that Tex19.1 is part of a specialised mechanism that guards against mutagenic endogenous retrovirus activity in germ cells and pluripotent cells and thus helps to maintain the integrity and stability of the genome through successive generations.},

  abstract = {Androgens control spermatogenesis, but germ cells themselves do not express a functional androgen receptor (AR). Androgen regulation is thought to be mediated by Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells, but their relative roles and the mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Using Cre/loxP technology, we have generated mice with a ubiquitous knockout of the AR as well as mice with a selective AR knockout in Sertoli cells (SC) only. Mice with a floxed exon 2 of the AR gene were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase ubiquitously or selectively in SC (under control of the anti-Müllerian hormone gene promoter). AR knockout males displayed a complete androgen insensitivity phenotype. Testes were located abdominally, and germ cell development was severely disrupted. In contrast, SC AR knockout males showed normal testis descent and development of the male urogenital tract. Expression of the homeobox gene Pem, which is androgen-regulated in SC, was severely decreased. Testis weight was reduced to 28\% of that in WT littermates. Stereological analysis indicated that the number of SC was unchanged, whereas numbers of spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids were reduced to 64\%, 3\%, and 0\% respectively of WT. These changes were associated with increased germ cell apoptosis and grossly reduced expression of genes specific for late spermatocyte or spermatid development. It is concluded that cell-autonomous action of the AR in SC is an absolute requirement for androgen maintenance of complete spermatogenesis, and that spermatocyte/spermatid development/survival critically depends on androgens.},

  abstract = {The switch from mitosis to meiosis is a unique feature of germ cell development. In mammals, meiotic initiation requires retinoic acid (RA), which activates meiotic inducers, including Stra8, but how the switch to meiosis is controlled in male germ cells (spermatogonia) remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of the Doublesex-related transcription factor DMRT1 in adult spermatogenesis using conditional gene targeting in the mouse. Loss of Dmrt1 causes spermatogonia to precociously exit the spermatogonial program and enter meiosis. Therefore, DMRT1 determines whether male germ cells undergo mitosis and spermatogonial differentiation or meiosis. Loss of Dmrt1 in spermatogonia also disrupts cyclical gene expression in Sertoli cells. DMRT1 acts in spermatogonia to restrict RA responsiveness, directly repress Stra8 transcription, and activate transcription of the spermatogonial differentiation factor Sohlh1, thereby preventing meiosis and promoting spermatogonial development. By coordinating spermatogonial development and mitotic amplification with meiosis, DMRT1 allows abundant, continuous production of sperm. Copyright \textbackslash{}copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Male mammals produce sperm for most of postnatal life and therefore require a robust germ line stem cell system, with precise balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Prior work established doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1) as a conserved transcriptional regulator of male sexual differentiation. Here we investigate the role of Dmrt1 in mouse spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homeostasis. We find that Dmrt1 maintains SSCs during steady state spermatogenesis, where it regulates expression of Plzf, another transcription factor required for SSC maintenance. We also find that Dmrt1 is required for recovery of spermatogenesis after germ cell depletion. Committed progenitor cells expressing Ngn3 normally do not contribute to SSCs marked by the Id4-Gfp transgene, but do so when spermatogonia are chemically depleted using busulfan. Removal of Dmrt1 from Ngn3-positive germ cells blocks the replenishment of Id4-GFP-positive SSCs and recovery of spermatogenesis after busulfan treatment. Our data therefore reveal that Dmrt1 supports SSC maintenance in two ways: allowing SSCs to remain in the stem cell pool under normal conditions; and enabling progenitor cells to help restore the stem cell pool after germ cell depletion. The Dmrt1 gene is a deeply conserved gonadal regulator that is expressed in all mitotic germ cells of the mouse, including spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We previously showed that Dmrt1 controls the mitosis/meiosis switch in differentiating mouse spermatogonia. Here we have examined the role of Dmrt1 in undifferentiated spermatogonia and found that Dmrt1 plays two crucial roles in sustaining the population of SSCs. First, Dmrt1 is required to maintain the SSC pool during normal conditions: loss of Dmrt1 in SSCs causes loss of the SSC maintenance factor PLZF and differentiation of SSCs. This result suggests that Dmrt1 is necessary for SSC self-renewal. Second, Dmrt1 is required to replenish SSCs after germ line depletion. We found that Ngn3-positive transit amplifying cells normally do not contribute to Id4-positive SSCs, but can do so when germ cells are chemically depleted by busulfan treatment. However, when Dmrt1 is lost in committed progenitor cells the ability to replenish SSCs after cytotoxic stress is completely lost. Our results suggest that Dmrt1 is important for SSC homeostasis and may provide new avenues for SSC manipulation.},

  abstract = {Male spermatogenesis is a complex biological process that is regulated by hormonal signals from the hypothalamus (GnRH), the pituitary gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and the testis (androgens, inhibin). The two key somatic cell types of the testis, Leydig and Sertoli cells, respond to gonadotropins and androgens and regulate the development and maturation of fertilization competent spermatozoa. Although progress has been made in the identification of specific transcripts that are translated in Sertoli and Leydig cells and their response to hormones, efforts to expand these studies have been restricted by technical hurdles. In order to address this problem we have applied an in vivo ribosome tagging strategy (RiboTag) that allows a detailed and physiologically relevant characterization of the ” translatome” (polysome-associated mRNAs) of Leydig or Sertoli cells in vivo. Our analysis identified all previously characterized Leydig and Sertoli cell-specific markers and identified in a comprehensive manner novel markers of Leydig and Sertoli cells; the translational response of these two cell types to gonadotropins or testosterone was also investigated. Modulation of a small subset of Sertoli cell genes occurred after FSH and testosterone stimulation. However, Leydig cells responded robustly to gonadotropin deprivation and LH restoration with acute changes in polysome-associated mRNAs. These studies identified the transcription factors that are induced by LH stimulation, uncovered novel potential regulators of LH signaling and steroidogenesis, and demonstrate the effects of LH on the translational machinery in vivo in the Leydig cell.},

Here, we review the relationship between protein and mRNA levels under various scenarios, such as steady state, long-term state changes, and short-term adaptation, demonstrating the complexity of gene expression regulation, especially during dynamic transitions. The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.},

We sought to determine whether the translational repression of the protamine 1 (Prm1) mRNA is necessary for normal spermatid differentiation in mice. To accomplish this we generated transgenic animals that carry a Prm1 transgene lacking its normal 3' untranslated region. Premature translation of Prm1 mRNA caused precocious condensation of spermatid nuclear DNA, abnormal head morphogenesis, and incomplete processing of Prm2 protein. Premature accumulation of Prm1 within syncytial spermatids in mice hemizygous for the transgene caused dominant male sterility, which in some cases was accompanied by a complete arrest in spermatid differentiation. These results demonstrate that correct temporal synthesis of Prm1 is necessary for the transition from nucleohistones to nucleoprotamines.},

  abstract = {During spermatogenesis, male germ cells temporally synthesize many proteins as they differentiate through meiosis and become spermatozoa. The germ cell Y-box protein, MSY2, constituting ≈0.7\% of total protein in male germ cells, binds to a consensus promoter element, and shows a general lack of RNA-binding specificity. Combining immunoprecipitation and suppressive subtractive hybridization, we identified populations of germ cell mRNAs that are not bound or bound by MSY2. The former population is enriched in cell growth and ubiquitously expressed mRNAs, whereas the latter population is enriched for stored or translationally delayed, male gamete-specific transcripts. Chromatin precipitation assays reveal that most of the MSY2 target mRNAs are transcribed from genes containing the Y-box DNA-binding motif in their promoters. In transgenic mice, mRNAs encoding exogenous GFP are directed or not directed into the MSY2-bound fraction by promoters containing or lacking the Y-box motif, respectively. We propose that MSY2 marks specific mRNAs in the nucleus for cytoplasmic storage, thereby linking transcription and mRNA storage/translational delay in meiotic and postmeiotic male germ cells of the mouse.},

  abstract = {The protamine 1 (Prm1) and sperm mitochondria-associated, cysteine-rich protein (Smcp) mRNAs exemplify a widespread pattern of mRNA-specific regulation of mRNA translation in post-meiotic spermatogenic cells, spermatids. Both mRNAs are transcribed and initially stored in free-mRNPs in early spermatids, and translated on polysomes in late spermatids. In this study, we demonstrate that the 5′ and 3′-UTRs and the 3′ terminus of the Smcp 3′-UTR are required for normal repression of the Smcp mRNA in transgenic mice. RNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry sequencing identified Y-box protein 2 (YBX2/MSY2) as the major protein that interacts with the 3′ terminus of the Smcp 3′-UTR and a Y-box recognition sequence, GCCACCU, in the translation control element that is necessary for Prm1 mRNA repression. Depletion of YBX2 in Ybx2-null mice prematurely activates Prm1 and Smcp mRNA translation in early spermatids. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals that the Smcp intron, the Smcp mRNA, and both Smcp–Gfp transgenic mRNAs are strongly concentrated in the chromatoid body, and that theYbx2-null mutation does not eliminate the Smcp mRNA from the chromatoid body. This and previous findings suggest that the Smcp pre-mRNA is spliced and associates with YBX2 in the chromatoid body, and that repressed free-mRNPs are stored in the general cytoplasm. As YBX2 is the predominant protein in testis free-mRNPs, it likely represses many mRNAs in early spermatids. The mechanisms by which YBX2 represses the Smcp and Prm1 mRNAs are relevant to reproductive medicine because mutations in the human YBX2 gene correlate with abnormal protamine expression and male infertility.},

This heterochromatic body is transcriptionally silenced and marked by increased ubiquitination of histone H2A. This led us to investigate the relationship between histone H2A ubiquitination and chromatin silencing in more detail. First, we found that ubiquitinated H2A also marks the silenced X chromosome of the Barr body in female somatic cells. Next, we studied a possible relationship between H2A ubiquitination, chromatin silencing, and unpaired chromatin in meiotic prophase. The mouse models used carry an unpaired autosomal region in male meiosis or unpaired X and Y chromosomes in female meiosis. We show that ubiquitinated histone H2A is associated with transcriptional silencing of large chromatin regions. This silencing in mammalian meiotic prophase cells concerns unpaired chromatin regions and resembles a phenomenon described for the fungus Neurospora crassa and named meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA.},

  abstract = {During the first meiotic prophase in male mammals, sex chromosomes undergo a program of transcriptional silencing called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). MSCI is triggered by accumulation of proteins like BRCA1, ATR, and γH2AX on unsynapsed chromosomes, followed by local changes on the sex chromatin, including histone modifications, incorporation of specific histone variants, non-histone proteins, and RNAs. It is generally thought that MSCI represents the transition of unsynapsed chromatin from a transcriptionally active state to a repressed state. However, transcription is generally low in the whole nucleus during the early stages of the first meiotic prophase, when markers of MSCI first appear, and is then reactivated globally during pachytene. Thus, an alternative possibility is that MSCI represents the targeted maintenance and/or reinforcement of a prior repressed state, i.e., a failure to reactivate. Here, we present an analysis of the temporal and spatial appearance of transcriptional and MSCI markers, as well as chromatin modifications related to transcriptional regulation. We show that levels of RNA pol II and histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) are low during leptotene, zygotene, and early pachytene, but increase strongly in mid-pachytene, indicating that reactivation occurs with some delay after synapsis. However, while transcription markers appear abundantly on the autosomes at mid-pachytene, they are not directed to the sex chromosomes. Interestingly, we found that chromatin modifications related to transcriptional silencing and/or MSCI, namely, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), γH2AX, SUMO1, and XMR, appear on the sex chromosomes before autosomes become reactivated. These results suggest that the onset of MSCI during late zygotene and early pachytene may prevent sex chromosome reactivation during mid-pachytene instead of promoting inactivation de novo. Additionally, we found temporal differences between the X and Y chromosomes in the recruitment of DNA repair and MSCI markers, indicating a differential regulation of these processes. We propose that many of the meiotic defects attributed to failure to silence sex chromosomes could be interpreted as a more general process of transcriptional misregulation that occurs under certain pathological circumstances in zygotene and early pachytene.},

However, another form of X-inactivation takes place in the male, during spermatogenesis, as germ cells enter meiosis. This second form of X-inactivation, called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) has emerged as a novel paradigm for studying the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. New studies have revealed that MSCI is a special example of a more general mechanism called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which silences chromosomes that fail to pair with their homologous partners and, in doing so, may protect against aneuploidy in subsequent generations. Furthermore, failure in MSCI is emerging as an important etiological factor in meiotic sterility.},

  abstract = {We present a probabilistic model for a document corpus that combines many of the desirable features of previous models. The model is called "GaP" for Gamma-Poisson, the distributions of the first and last random variable. GaP is a factor model, that is it gives an approximate factorization of the document-term matrix into a product of matrices Λ and X. These factors have strictly non-negative terms. GaP is a generative probabilistic model that assigns finite probabilities to documents in a corpus. It can be computed with an efficient and simple EM recurrence. For a suitable choice of parameters, the GaP factorization maximizes independence between the factors. So it can be used as an independent-component algorithm adapted to document data. The form of the GaP model is empirically as well as analytically motivated. It gives very accurate results as a probabilistic model (measured via perplexity) and as a retrieval model. The GaP model projects documents and terms into a low-dimensional space of "themes," and models texts as "passages" of terms on the same theme.},

Here we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of over 2,000 FGCs and their gonadal niche cells in female and male human embryos spanning several developmental stages. We found that female FGCs undergo four distinct sequential phases characterized by mitosis, retinoic acid signaling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis. Male FGCs develop through stages of migration, mitosis, and cell-cycle arrest. Individual embryos of both sexes simultaneously contain several subpopulations, highlighting the asynchronous and heterogeneous nature of FGC development. Moreover, we observed reciprocal signaling interactions between FGCs and their gonadal niche cells, including activation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Notch signaling pathways. Our work provides key insights into the crucial features of human FGCs during their highly ordered mitotic, meiotic, and gametogenetic processes in vivo.},

While recent studies using single cell transcriptome analysis illustrate the power to measure and understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, processing large amounts of RNA-seq data from heterogeneous cell populations creates the need for readily accessible tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles. The present study presents a generally applicable analytic pipeline (SINCERA: a computational pipeline for SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis) for processing scRNA-seq data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for: 1) the distinction and identification of major cell types; 2) the identification of cell type specific gene signatures; and 3) the determination of driving forces of given cell types. We applied this pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis, we distinguished major cell types of fetal mouse lung, including epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, pericyte, and fibroblast-like cell types, and identified cell type specific gene signatures, bioprocesses, and key regulators.

We measured messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance and protein production through the yeast meiotic sporulation program and found strong, stage-specific expression for most genes, achieved through control of both mRNA levels and translational efficiency. Monitoring of protein production timing revealed uncharacterized recombination factors and extensive organellar remodeling. Meiotic translation is also shifted toward noncanonical sites, including short open reading frames (ORFs) on unannnotated transcripts and upstream regions of known transcripts (uORFs). Ribosome occupancy at near-cognate uORFs was associated with more efficient ORF translation; by contrast, some AUG uORFs, often exposed by regulated 5′ leader extensions, acted competitively. This work reveals pervasive translational control in meiosis and helps to illuminate the molecular basis of the broad restructuring of meiotic cells.},

In this review, we break down the strategies used by this novel class of methods, and organize their components into a common framework, highlighting several practical advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods. We also give an overview of new insights these methods have already provided regarding the wiring and gene regulation of cell differentiation. As the trajectory inference field is still in its infancy, we propose several future developments that will ultimately lead to a global and data-driven way of studying immune cell differentiation.},

  abstract = {Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages. Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells.

  abstract = {Cellular reprogramming highlights the epigenetic plasticity of the somatic cell state. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerging roles in epigenetic regulation, but their potential functions in reprogramming cell fate have been largely unexplored. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the expression patterns of over 16,000 genes, including 437 lncRNAs, during defined stages of reprogramming to pluripotency. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used as an intuitive way to structure and interrogate transcriptome data at the single-cell level. Early molecular events during reprogramming involved the activation of Ras signaling pathways, along with hundreds of lncRNAs. Loss-of-function studies showed that activated lncRNAs can repress lineage-specific genes, while lncRNAs activated in multiple reprogramming cell types can regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that reprogramming cells activate defined sets of functionally relevant lncRNAs and provide a resource to further investigate how dynamic changes in the transcriptome reprogram cell state.},

We quantified transcriptomes and proteomes in fission yeast during cellular proliferation and quiescence.

The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume.

We quantified absolute abundances of 5,354 mRNAs and 2,198 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ten environmental conditions and protein turnover for 1,384 proteins under a reference condition. The overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances across all conditions was low (0.46), but for differentially expressed proteins (n = 202), the median mRNA-protein correlation was 0.88. We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61\% and 15\% of its variance. Metabolic flux balance analysis further showed that only mitochondrial fluxes were positively associated with changes at the transcript level.

  abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

Moreover, 8–19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells.

  abstract = {The intimate synapsis of homologous chromosome pairs (homologs) by synaptonemal complexes (SCs) is an essential feature of meiosis. In many organisms, synapsis and homologous recombination are interdependent: recombination promotes SC formation and SCs are required for crossing-over. Moreover, several studies indicate that initiation of SC assembly occurs at sites where crossovers will subsequently form. However, recent analyses in budding yeast and fruit fly imply a special role for centromeres in the initiation of SC formation. In addition, in budding yeast, persistent SC–dependent centromere-association facilitates the disjunction of chromosomes that have failed to become connected by crossovers. Here, we examine the interplay between SCs, recombination, and centromeres in a mammal. In mouse spermatocytes, centromeres do not serve as SC initiation sites and are invariably the last regions to synapse. However, centromeres are refractory to de-synapsis during diplonema and remain associated by short SC fragments. Since SC–dependent centromere association is lost before diakinesis, a direct role in homolog segregation seems unlikely. However, post–SC disassembly, we find evidence of inter-centromeric connections that could play a more direct role in promoting homolog biorientation and disjunction. A second class of persistent SC fragments is shown to be crossover-dependent. Super-resolution structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) reveals that these structures initially connect separate homolog axes and progressively diminish as chiasmata form. Thus, DNA crossing-over (which occurs during pachynema) and axis remodeling appear to be temporally distinct aspects of chiasma formation. SIM analysis of the synapsis and crossover-defective mutant Sycp1−/− implies that SCs prevent unregulated fusion of homolog axes. We propose that SC fragments retained during diplonema stabilize nascent bivalents and help orchestrate local chromosome reorganization that promotes centromere and chiasma function. Gamete cells, such as sperm and eggs, form via the specialized cell division called meiosis. Essential and interdependent features of meiosis include the pairing, recombination, and segregation of maternal and paternal chromosomes. Chromosome pairing culminates with formation of synaptonemal complexes (SCs), zipper-like structures that connect the structural cores or axes of homologous chromosomes. Although SC is known to be important for crossover recombination, details of its function remain enigmatic. In this study, we analyze mouse spermatocytes to investigate the interplay between SC, recombination, and centromeres (the structures that direct chromosome segregation). We show that SC prevents unregulated interactions between chromosome axes. This function appears to be especially important at chromosome ends and at crossover sites where DNA exchange must be coordinated with structural exchange of chromosome axes. We also show that centromeres remain associated by short fragments of SC after general chromosome desynapsis has occurred. Furthermore, we detect a distinct type of inter-centromeric connection that persists even after centromeres desynapse. Such connections may facilitate the segregation of chromosomes that have failed to crossover. Together, our data provide new insights into the functions of SC and raise the possibility of a back-up chromosome segregation system in mammals analogous to those described in fruit flies and budding yeast.},

  abstract = {The chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, comprising events such as laying down of meiotic cohesins, synapsis between homologs, and homologous recombination, must be preceded and enabled by the regulated induction of meiotic prophase genes. This gene regulatory program is poorly understood, particularly in organisms with a segregated germline. We characterized the gene regulatory program of meiotic prophase as it occurs in the mouse fetal ovary. By profiling gene expression in the mouse fetal ovary in mutants with whole tissue and single-cell techniques, we identified 104 genes expressed specifically in pre-meiotic to pachytene germ cells. We characterized the regulation of these genes by 1) retinoic acid (RA), which induces meiosis, 2) Dazl, which is required for germ cell competence to respond to RA, and 3) Stra8, a downstream target of RA required for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase. Initial induction of practically all identified meiotic prophase genes requires Dazl. In the presence of Dazl, RA induces at least two pathways: one Stra8-independent, and one Stra8-dependent. Genes vary in their induction by Stra8, spanning fully Stra8-independent, partially Stra8-independent, and fully Stra8-dependent. Thus, Stra8 regulates the entirety of the chromosomal program but plays a more nuanced role in governing the gene expression program. We propose that Stra8-independent gene expression enables the stockpiling of selected meiotic structural proteins prior to the commencement of the chromosomal program. Unexpectedly, we discovered that Stra8 is required for prompt down-regulation of itself and Rec8. Germ cells that have expressed and down-regulated Stra8 are refractory to further Stra8 expression. Negative feedback of Stra8, and subsequent resistance to further Stra8 expression, may ensure a single, restricted pulse of Stra8 expression. Collectively, our findings reveal a gene regulatory logic by which germ cells prepare for the chromosomal program of meiotic prophase, and ensure that it is induced only once. The formation of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells requires a specialized reductive cell division known as meiosis. This reductive division is enabled by chromosomal events that occur during meiotic prophase, including synapsis and crossing-over of homologous chromosomes. These chromosomal events involve meiosis-specific genes that must be expressed before they act during meiosis. Using gene expression profiling, we identified a set of mammalian meiosis-specific genes. To understand how expression of these genes is controlled, we examined their expression in the absence of known regulators of the chromosomal events: 1) retinoic acid (RA), which induces meiosis, 2) Dazl, which is required for germ cell competence to respond to RA, and 3) Stra8, which is induced by RA and is required for the chromosomal events of meiotic prophase. We uncover two key features of gene regulation. First, while the genes require RA and Dazl to be expressed, they vary in their dependence on Stra8, thus creating a regulatory hierarchy. Genes induced independently of Stra8, and thus early in this hierarchy, may encode proteins that are stockpiled in anticipation of the chromosomal events. Second, Stra8 induces its own down-regulation, and may thus prevent repeated induction of meiosis in a single germ cell.},

We have studied the transcriptional program that drives this developmental process in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using DNA microarrays. Here we show that hundreds of genes are regulated in successive waves of transcription that correlate with major biological events of meiosis and sporulation. Each wave is associated with specific promoter motifs. Clusters of neighboring genes (mostly close to telomeres) are co-expressed early in the process, which reflects a more global control of these genes. We find that two Atf-like transcription factors are essential for the expression of late genes and formation of spores, and identify dozens of potential Atf target genes. Comparison with the meiotic program of the distantly related Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals an unexpectedly small shared meiotic transcriptome, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of meiosis evolved independently in both species.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved Spo11 protein. Studies in yeast have shown that DSB formation requires several other proteins, the role and conservation of which remain unknown. Here we show that two of these Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, Mei4 and Rec114, are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotes. Mei4(-/-) mice are deficient in meiotic DSB formation, thus showing the functional conservation of Mei4 in mice. Cytological analyses reveal that, in mice, MEI4 is localized in discrete foci on the axes of meiotic chromosomes that do not overlap with DMC1 and RPA foci. We thus propose that MEI4 acts as a structural component of the DSB machinery that ensures meiotic DSB formation on chromosome axes. We show that mouse MEI4 and REC114 proteins interact directly, and we identify conserved motifs as required for this interaction. Finally, the unexpected, concomitant absence of Mei4 and Rec114, as well as of Mnd1, Hop2, and Dmc1, in some eukaryotic species (particularly Neurospora crassa, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) suggests the existence of Mei4-Rec114-dependent and Mei4-Rec114-independent mechanisms for DSB formation, and a functional relationship between the chromosome axis and DSB formation.},

Here, we show that several histone modifications are enriched at the active mouse Psmb9 hotspot, and we distinguish those marks that precede from those that follow hotspot recombinational activity. H3K4Me3, H3K4Me2 and H3K9Ac are specifically enriched in the chromatids that carry an active initiation site, and in the absence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Spo11(-/-) mice. We thus propose that these marks are part of the substrate for recombination initiation at the Psmb9 hotspot. In contrast, hyperacetylation of H4 is increased as a consequence of DSB formation, as shown by its dependency on Spo11 and by the enrichment detected on both recombining chromatids. In addition, the comparison with another hotspot, Hlx1, strongly suggests that H3K4Me3 and H4 hyperacetylation are common features of DSB formation and repair, respectively. Altogether, the chromatin signatures of the Psmb9 and Hlx1 hotspots provide a basis for understanding the distribution of meiotic recombination.},

We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes.

Identifying disease-specific metabolic characters in metabolic disorders through topology analysis. Antimetabolites and anti-cancer drug development. The arising prevalence of metabolic diseases calls for a holistic approach for analysis of the underlying nature of abnormalities in cellular functions. Through mathematic representation and topological analysis of cellular metabolism, GEnome scale metabolic Models (GEMs) provide a promising framework for uncovering the mechanistic relationship between genotype and phenotype. GEMs hereby enable uncovering associations between cellular physiology and pathology in a systematic manner. Here we review the current progress on reconstruction of human GEMs and how they have been employed as scaffold for interpreting multi-omics high-throughput data with the objective to identify disease-specific metabolic features. We further discuss recent achievements on how to apply these findings for potential target identification and therapeutic drug development. There are, however, challenges in developing models that correctly describe interactions between cells or tissues, and we therefore discuss how GEMs can be integrated with blood circulation models. Finally, we end the review with proposing some possible future research directions.},

Studies of mutations in model organisms and of human haplotype patterns are leading to a clearer understanding of how meiosis has adapted from yeast to humans, the genes that control the dynamics of chromosomes during meiosis, and how meiosis is tied to gametic success. Genetic disruptions and meiotic errors have important roles in infertility and the aetiology of developmental defects, especially aneuploidy. An understanding of the regulation of meiosis, coupled with advances in genomics, may ultimately allow us to diagnose the causes of meiosis-based infertilities, more wisely apply assisted reproductive technologies, and derive functional germ cells.},

  abstract = {Understanding mammalian spermatozoan development and the events surrounding fertilization has grown slowly, in part because of uncertainty about the number and identity of the cellular components involved. Determination of those transcripts expressed specifically by germ cells should provide an inclusive list of probable critical proteins. Here, total mouse testis transcript profiles were trimmed of transcripts found in cultures enriched in Sertoli or interstitial cells to yield a germ cell-enriched transcript profile. Monitoring of changes of this profile in the developing testis identified 1,652 genes whose transcript abundance increased markedly coincident with the onset of meiosis. Remarkably, 351 of these genes (≈20\%) appear to be expressed only in the male germline. Germ cell-specific transcripts are much less common earlier in testis development. Further analysis of the UniGene EST database coupled with quantitative PCR indicates that ≈4\% of the mouse genome is dedicated to expression in postmeiotic male germ cells. Most or many of the protein products of these transcripts are probably retained in mature spermatozoa. Targeted disruption of 19 of these genes has indicated that a majority have roles critical for normal fertility. Thus, we find an astonishing number of genes expressed specifically by male germ cells late in development. This extensive group provides a plethora of potential targets for germ cell-directed contraception and a staggering number of candidate proteins that could be critical for fertilization.},

Toward this objective, we explored the spermatogenic effects of a selective small-molecule inhibitor (JQ1) of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) subfamily of epigenetic reader proteins. Here, we report potent inhibition of the testis-specific member BRDT, which is essential for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis. Biochemical and crystallographic studies confirm that occupancy of the BRDT acetyl-lysine binding pocket by JQ1 prevents recognition of acetylated histone H4. Treatment of mice with JQ1 reduced seminiferous tubule area, testis size, and spermatozoa number and motility without affecting hormone levels. Although JQ1-treated males mate normally, inhibitory effects of JQ1 evident at the spermatocyte and round spermatid stages cause a complete and reversible contraceptive effect. These data establish a new contraceptive that can cross the blood:testis boundary and inhibit bromodomain activity during spermatogenesis, providing a lead compound targeting the male germ cell for contraception.

  abstract = {Background:\&\#10;Mammalian spermatogenesis involves formation of haploid cells from the male germline and then a complex morphological transformation to generate motile sperm. Focusing on meiotic prophase, some tissue-specific transcription factors are known (A-MYB) or suspected (RFX2) to play important roles in modulating gene expression in pachytene spermatocytes. The current work was initiated to identify both downstream and upstream regulatory connections for Rfx2.\&\#10;Results:\&\#10;Searches of pachytene up-regulated genes identified high affinity RFX binding sites (X boxes) in promoter regions of several new genes: Adam5, Pdcl2, and Spag6. We confirmed a strong promoter-region X-box for Alf, a germ cell-specific variant of general transcription factor TFIIA. Using Alf as an example of a target gene, we showed that its promoter is stimulated by RFX2 in transfected cells and used ChIP analysis to show that the promoter is occupied by RFX2 in vivo. Turning to upstream regulation of the Rfx2 promoter, we identified a cluster of three binding sites (MBS) for the MYB family of transcription factors. Because testis is one of the few sites of A-myb expression, and because spermatogenesis arrests in pachytene in A-myb knockout mice, the MBS cluster implicates Rfx2 as an A-Myb target. Electrophoretic gel-shift, ChIP, and co-transfection assays all support a role for these MYB sites in Rfx2 expression. Further, Rfx2 expression was virtually eliminated in A-myb knockout testes. Immunohistology on testis sections showed that A-MYB expression is up-regulated only after pachytene spermatocytes have clearly moved away from the tubule wall, which correlates with onset of RFX2 expression. By contrast, B-MYB expression is prevalent only in earlier spermatocytes and spermatogonia.\&\#10;Conclusions:\&\#10;With an expanding list of likely target genes, RFX2 is potentially an important transcriptional regulator in pachytene spermatocytes. Rfx2 itself is a good candidate to be regulated by A-MYB, which is essential for meiotic progression. If Alf is a genuine RFX2 target, then A-myb, Rfx2, and Alf may form part of a transcriptional network that is vital for completion of meiosis and preparation for post-meiotic differentiation.},

  abstract = {The transcriptional regulation of mammalian meiosis is poorly characterized, owing to few genetic and ex vivo models. From a genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor MYBL1 as a male-specific master regulator of several crucial meiotic processes. Spermatocytes bearing a novel separation-of-function allele (Mybl1(repro9)) had subtle defects in autosome synapsis in pachynema, a high incidence of unsynapsed sex chromosomes, incomplete double-strand break repair on synapsed pachytene chromosomes and a lack of crossing over. MYBL1 protein appears in pachynema, and its mutation caused specific alterations in expression of diverse genes, including some translated postmeiotically. These data, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) experiments and bioinformatic analysis of promoters, identified direct targets of MYBL1 regulation. The results reveal that MYBL1 is a master regulator of meiotic genes that are involved in multiple processes in spermatocytes, particularly those required for cell cycle progression through pachynema.},

  abstract = {Background:\&\#10;Mammalian germ cells undergo meiosis to produce sperm or eggs, haploid cells that are primed to meet and propagate life. Meiosis is initiated by retinoic acid and meiotic prophase is the first and most complex stage of meiosis when homologous chromosomes pair to exchange genetic information. Errors in meiosis can lead to infertility and birth defects. However, despite the importance of this process, germ cell-specific gene expression patterns during meiosis remain undefined due to difficulty in obtaining pure germ cell samples, especially in females, where prophase occurs in the embryonic ovary. Indeed, mixed signals from both germ cells and somatic cells complicate gonadal transcriptome studies.\&\#10;Results:\&\#10;We developed a machine-learning method for identifying germ cell-specific patterns of gene expression in microarray data from mammalian gonads, specifically during meiotic initiation and prophase. At 10\% recall, the method detected spermatocyte genes and oocyte genes with 90\% and 94\% precision, respectively. Our method outperformed gonadal expression levels and gonadal expression correlations in predicting germ cell-specific expression. Top-predicted spermatocyte and oocyte genes were both preferentially localized to the X chromosome and significantly enriched for essential genes. Also identified were transcription factors and microRNAs that might regulate germ cell-specific expression. Finally, we experimentally validated Rps6ka3, a top-predicted X-linked spermatocyte gene. Protein localization studies in the mouse testis revealed germ cell-specific expression of RPS6KA3, mainly detected in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia and prophase spermatocytes.\&\#10;Conclusions:\&\#10;We have demonstrated that, through the use of machine-learning methods, it is possible to detect germ cell-specific expression from gonadal microarray data. Results from this study improve our understanding of the transition from germ cells to meiocytes in the mammalian gonad. Further, this approach is applicable to other tissues for which isolating cell populations remains difficult.},

Although previous studies have elucidated the importance of testis specific gene expression, the exact transcripts and comprehensive gene expression patterns remain unknown. Large scale sequencing techniques have enabled cost effective analysis of gene expression and isoform studies. Using the SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencing platform we have investigated the gene expression patterns at five different time points during the first wave on murine spermatogenesis. Our results highlight the upregulation of spermatogenesis related biological processes and associated cellular components. Elucidation of differential gene expression at important time points during the sperm development emphasizes the importance of correct timing of gene expression within biological processes. Differential gene level expression was analyzed with R/Bioconductor's Limma package and isoform analysis was conducted with the Cufflinks pipeline. At gene level total of 2494 differentially expressed genes were identified and Cufflinks characterized over 160 000 gene isoforms, of which 29\% were novel transcripts assigned to known genes. Isoforms were detected for 57\% of expressed genes and in a total over 26 000 genes were expressed in the testis. Differential promoter and transcription start site usage appears also to play a role in regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we identified 947 upregulated long non-coding RNAs during the first wave of spermatogenesis. These RNAs appeared to be highly specific to different time points. Transcriptomic analysis of testis tissue samples is highly informative due to the large number of expressed genes and identified isoforms. Our study provides a very valuable basis for investigation of gene isoforms and regulation and factors contributing to male fertility.},

Using gene expression clustering we defined over 1,000 novel meiotically-expressed genes. We also developed a computational de-convolution approach and used it to estimate cell type-specific gene expression in pre-meiotic, meiotic and post-meiotic cells. In addition, we detected 13,000 novel alternative splicing events around 40 of which preserve an open reading frame, and found experimental support for 159 computational gene predictions. A comparison of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) ChIP-Seq signals with RNA-Seq coverage shows that gene expression correlates well with Pol II signals, both at promoters and along the gene body. However, we observe numerous instances of non-canonical promoter usage, as well as intergenic Pol II peaks that potentially delineate unannotated promoters, enhancers or small RNA clusters.CONCLUSIONS:Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of gene expression throughout mouse meiosis and spermatogenesis. Importantly, we find over a thousand of novel meiotic genes and over 5,000 novel potentially coding isoforms. These data should be a valuable resource for future studies of meiosis and spermatogenesis in mammals.},

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

  abstract = {When analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, constructing a pseudo-temporal path to order cells based on the gradual transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population. Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at https://github.com/zji90/TSCAN and as a Bioconductor package. \textbackslash{}copyright The Author(s) 2016.

Analyzing historical pipeline data, Nelson et al. 2015 (Nat. Genet.) concluded pipeline drug targets with human genetic evidence of disease association are twice as likely to lead to approved drugs. Taking advantage of recent clinical development advances and rapid growth in GWAS datasets, we extend the original work using updated data, test whether genetic evidence predicts future successes and introduce statistical models adjusting for target and indication-level properties. Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III. When causal genes are clear (Mendelian traits and GWAS associations linked to coding variants), we find the use of human genetic evidence increases approval from Phase I by greater than two-fold, and, for Mendelian associations, the positive association holds prospectively. Our findings suggest investments into genomics and genetics are likely to be beneficial to companies deploying this strategy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs.},

DSBs can be directly mapped using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Nevertheless, the genome-wide mapping of recombination hotspots in mammals is still a challenge due to the low frequency of recombination, high heterogeneity of the germ cell population, and the relatively low efficiency of ChIP. To overcome these limitations we have developed a novel method—single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequencing (SSDS)—that specifically detects protein-bound single-stranded DNA at DSB ends. SSDS comprises a computational framework for the specific detection of ssDNA-derived reads in a sequencing library and a new library preparation procedure for the enrichment of fragments originating from ssDNA. The use of our technique reduces the nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) background {$>$}10-fold. Our method can be extended to other systems where the identification of ssDNA or DSBs is desired.},

Here, we determined the NMR solution structure of the zf-CW domain of the human zf-CW and PWWP domain containing protein 1 (ZCWPW1). The zf-CW domain adopts a new fold in which a zinc ion is coordinated tetrahedrally by four conserved Cys ligand residues. The tertiary structure of the zf-CW domain partially resembles that adopted by the plant homeo domain (PHD) finger bound to the histone tail, suggesting that the zf-CW domain and the PHD finger have similar functions. The solution structure of the complex of the zf-CW domain with the histone H3 tail peptide (1-10) with trimethylated K4 clarified its binding mode. Our structural and biochemical studies have identified the zf-CW domain as a member of the histone modification reader modules for epigenetic regulation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Over 25\% of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome reside within Alu elements, the most abundant human repeats. The methylation of Alu elements is an important mechanism to suppress Alu transcription and subsequent retrotransposition. Decades of studies revealed that Alu methylation is highly dynamic during early development and aging. Recently, many environmental factors were shown to have a great impact on Alu methylation. In addition, aberrant Alu methylation has been documented to be an early event in many tumors and Alu methylation levels have been associated with tumor aggressiveness. The assessment of the Alu methylation has become an important approach for early diagnosis and/or prognosis of cancer. This review focuses on the dynamic Alu methylation during development, aging, and tumor genesis. The cause and consequence of Alu methylation changes will be discussed.},

Here, we have investigated the interaction of the PWWP domain with modified histone tails using peptide arrays and show that it specifically recognizes the histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation mark. H3K36me3 is known to be a repressive modification correlated with DNA methylation in mammals and heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These results were confirmed by equilibrium peptide binding studies and pulldown experiments with native histones and purified native nucleosomes. The PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction is important for the subnuclear localization of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-fused Dnmt3a. Furthermore, the PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction increases the activity of Dnmt3a for methylation of nucleosomal DNA as observed using native nucleosomes isolated from human cells after demethylation of the DNA with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine as substrate for methylation with Dnmt3a. These data suggest that the interaction of the PWWP domain with H3K36me3 is involved in targeting of Dnmt3a to chromatin carrying that mark, a model that is in agreement with several studies on the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation and H3K36me3.},

  abstract = {In mammalian development, epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation patterns, play a crucial role in defining cell fate but also represent epigenetic barriers that restrict developmental potential. At two points in the life cycle, DNA methylation marks are reprogrammed on a global scale, concomitant with restoration of developmental potency. DNA methylation patterns are subsequently re-established with the commitment towards a distinct cell fate. This reprogramming of DNA methylation takes place firstly on fertilization in the zygote, and secondly in primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are the direct progenitors of sperm or oocyte. In each reprogramming window, a unique set of mechanisms regulates DNA methylation erasure and re-establishment. Recent advances have uncovered roles for the TET3 hydroxylase and passive demethylation, together with base excision repair (BER) and the elongator complex, in methylation erasure from the zygote. Deamination by AID, BER and passive demethylation have been implicated in reprogramming in PGCs, but the process in its entirety is still poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the dynamics of DNA methylation reprogramming in PGCs and the zygote, the mechanisms involved and the biological significance of these events. Advances in our understanding of such natural epigenetic reprogramming are beginning to aid enhancement of experimental reprogramming in which the role of potential mechanisms can be investigated in vitro. Conversely, insights into in vitro reprogramming techniques may aid our understanding of epigenetic reprogramming in the germline and supply important clues in reprogramming for therapies in regenerative medicine.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a major form of DNA modification in the mammalian genome that plays critical roles in chromatin structure and gene expression. In general, DNA methylation is stably maintained in somatic tissues. However, DNA methylation patterns and levels show dynamic changes during development. Specifically, the genome undergoes two waves of global demethylation and remethylation for the purpose of producing the next generation. The first wave occurs in the germline, initiated with the erasure of global methylation in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and completed with the establishment of sex-specific methylation patterns during later stages of germ cell development. The second wave occurs after fertilization, including the erasure of most methylation marks inherited from the gametes and the subsequent establishment of the embryonic methylation pattern. The two waves of DNA methylation reprogramming involve both distinct and shared mechanisms. In this review article, we provide an overview of the key reprogramming events, focusing on the important players in these processes, including DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5mC dioxygenases.},

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) ensures replication fidelity by correcting mismatches generated during DNA replication. Although human MMR has been reconstituted in~vitro, how MMR occurs in~vivo is unknown. Here, we show that an epigenetic histone mark, H3K36me3, is required in~vivo to recruit the mismatch recognition protein hMutSα (hMSH2-hMSH6) onto chromatin through direct interactions with the hMSH6 PWWP domain. The abundance of H3K36me3 in G1 and early S phases ensures that hMutSα is enriched on chromatin before mispairs are introduced during DNA replication. Cells lacking the H3K36 trimethyltransferase SETD2 display microsatellite instability (MSI) and an elevated spontaneous mutation frequency, characteristic of MMR-deficient cells. This work reveals that a histone mark regulates MMR in human cells and explains the long-standing puzzle of MSI-positive cancer cells that lack detectable mutations in known MMR genes.},

  abstract = {Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is an important histone mark involved in both transcription elongation and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). It is known that H3K36me3 recruits the mismatch-recognition protein MutSα to replicating chromatin via its physical interaction with MutSα’s PWWP domain, but the exact role of H3K36me3 in transcription is undefined. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with whole genome DNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrate here that H3K36me3, together with MutSα, is involved in protecting against mutation, preferentially in actively transcribed genomic regions. We found that H3K36me3 and MutSα are much more co-enriched in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and non-transcribed regions. The H3K36me3–MutSα co-enrichment correlated with a much lower mutation frequency in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and non-transcribed regions. Correspondingly, depleting H3K36me3 or disrupting the H3K36me3–MutSα interaction elevated the spontaneous mutation frequency in actively transcribed genes, but had little influence on the mutation frequency in non-transcribed or transcriptionally inactive regions. Similarly, H2O2-induced mutations, which mainly cause base oxidations, preferentially occurred in actively transcribed genes in MMR-deficient cells. The data presented here suggest that H3K36me3-mediated MMR preferentially safeguards actively transcribed genes not only during replication by efficiently correcting mispairs in early replicating chromatin, but also during transcription by directly or indirectly removing DNA lesions associated with a persistently open chromatin structure.},

  abstract = {Although both homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining can repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the mechanisms by which one of these pathways is chosen over the other remain unclear. Here we show that transcriptionally active chromatin is preferentially repaired by HR. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze repair of multiple DSBs induced throughout the human genome, we identify an HR-prone subset of DSBs that recruit the HR protein RAD51, undergo resection and rely on RAD51 for efficient repair. These DSBs are located in actively transcribed genes and are targeted to HR repair via the transcription elongation–associated mark trimethylated histone H3 K36. Concordantly, depletion of SETD2, the main H3 K36 trimethyltransferase, severely impedes HR at such DSBs. Our study thereby demonstrates a primary role in DSB repair of the chromatin context in which a break occurs.},

  abstract = {Histone modifications establish the chromatin states that coordinate the DNA damage response. In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.},

When DNA methylation-based transposon control is defective, meiotic chromosome pairing is consistently impaired during spermatogenesis: How and why meiosis is vulnerable to transposon activity is unknown. Using two DNA methylation-deficient backgrounds, the Dnmt3L and Miwi2 mutant mice, we reveal that DNA methylation is largely dispensable for silencing transposons before meiosis onset. After this, it becomes crucial to back up to a developmentally programmed H3K9me2 loss. Massive retrotransposition does not occur following transposon derepression, but the meiotic chromatin landscape is profoundly affected. Indeed, H3K4me3 marks gained over transcriptionally active transposons correlate with formation of SPO11-dependent double-strand breaks and recruitment of the DMC1 repair enzyme in Dnmt3L−/− meiotic cells, whereas these features are normally exclusive to meiotic recombination hot spots. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methylation restrains transposons from adopting chromatin characteristics amenable to meiotic recombination, which we propose prevents the occurrence of erratic chromosomal events.},

The function of most KZFPs is unknown, but a few have been demonstrated to repress transposable elements in embryonic stem (ES) cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator TRIM28 and associated mediators of histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)-dependent heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Depletion of TRIM28 in human or mouse ES cells triggers the upregulation of a broad range of transposable elements4,10,11, and recent data based on a few specific examples have pointed to an arms race between hosts and transposable elements as an important driver of KZFP gene selection5. Here, to obtain a global view of this phenomenon, we combined phylogenetic and genomic studies to investigate the evolutionary emergence of KZFP genes in vertebrates and to identify their targets in the human genome. First, we unexpectedly reassigned the root of the family to a common ancestor of coelacanths and tetrapods. Second, although we confirmed that the majority of KZFPs bind transposable elements and pinpoint cases of ongoing co-evolution, we found that most of their transposable element targets have lost all transposition potential. Third, by examining the interplay between human KZFPs and other transcriptional modulators, we obtained evidence that KZFPs exploit evolutionarily conserved fragments of transposable elements as regulatory platforms long after the arms race against these genetic invaders has ended. Together, our results demonstrate that KZFPs partner with transposable elements to build a largely species-restricted layer of epigenetic regulation.},

Here, we expand on recent studies of nucleotide-resolution DSB maps in mouse spermatocytes. We find that trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 around DSB hotspots is highly correlated, both spatially and quantitatively, with trimethylation of H3 lysine 4, consistent with coordinated formation and action of both PRDM9-dependent histone modifications. In contrast, the DSB-responsive kinase ATM contributes independently of PRDM9 to controlling hotspot activity, and combined action of ATM and PRDM9 can explain nearly two-thirds of the variation in DSB frequency between hotspots. DSBs were modestly underrepresented in most repetitive sequences such as segmental duplications and transposons. Nonetheless, numerous DSBs form within repetitive sequences in each meiosis and some classes of repeats are preferentially targeted. Implications of these findings are discussed for evolution of PRDM9 and its role in hybrid strain sterility in mice. Finally, we document the relationship between mouse strain-specific DNA sequence variants within PRDM9 recognition motifs and attendant differences in recombination outcomes. Our results provide further insights into the complex web of factors that influence meiotic recombination patterns.},

DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) and its regulatory factor, DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (Dnmt3L), are both required for the de novo DNA methylation of imprinted genes in mammalian germ cells. Dnmt3L interacts specifically with unmethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 through its amino-terminal PHD (plant homeodomain)-like domain. Here we show, with the use of crystallography, that the carboxy-terminal domain of human Dnmt3L interacts with the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a, demonstrating that Dnmt3L has dual functions of binding the unmethylated histone tail and activating DNA methyltransferase. The complexed C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L showed further dimerization through Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interaction, forming a tetrameric complex with two active sites. Substitution of key non-catalytic residues at the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3L interface or the Dnmt3a-Dnmt3a interface eliminated enzymatic activity. Molecular modelling of a DNA-Dnmt3a dimer indicated that the two active sites are separated by about one DNA helical turn. The C-terminal domain of Dnmt3a oligomerizes on DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. A periodicity in the activity of Dnmt3a on long DNA revealed a correlation of methylated CpG sites at distances of eight to ten base pairs, indicating that oligomerization leads Dnmt3a to methylate DNA in a periodic pattern. A similar periodicity is observed for the frequency of CpG sites in the differentially methylated regions of 12 maternally imprinted mouse genes. These results suggest a basis for the recognition and methylation of differentially methylated regions in imprinted genes, involving the detection of both nucleosome modification and CpG spacing.},

We also observe a novel pattern: exons are preferentially marked with H3K36me3 relative to introns. H3K36me3 exon marking is dependent on transcription and is found at lower levels in alternatively spliced exons, supporting a splicing-related marking mechanism. We further show that the difference in H3K36me3 marking between exons and introns is evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse.

Recent studies have shown that distinct chromatin signatures mark a variety of functional genomic elements and that subtle variations of these signatures mark elements with different functions. To identify novel chromatin signatures in the human genome, we apply a de novo pattern-finding algorithm to genome-wide maps of histone modifications. We recover previously known chromatin signatures associated with promoters and enhancers. We also observe several chromatin signatures with strong enrichment of H3K36me3 marking exons. Closer examination reveals that H3K36me3 is found on well-positioned nucleosomes at exon 5′ ends, and that this modification is a global mark of exon expression that also correlates with alternative splicing. Additionally, we observe strong enrichment of H2BK5me1 and H4K20me1 at highly expressed exons near the 5′ end, in contrast to the opposite distribution of H3K36me3-marked exons. Finally, we also recover frequently occurring chromatin signatures displaying enrichment of repressive histone modifications. These signatures mark distinct repeat sequences and are associated with distinct modes of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation.},

The human Setd1A histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex was found to physically associate with the RNA polymerase II large subunit. The Wdr82 component of the Setd1A complex interacts with the RNA recognition motif of Setd1A and additionally binds to the Ser5-phosphorylated C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is involved in initiation of transcription, but does not bind to an unphosphorylated or Ser2-phosphorylated C-terminal domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Setd1A is localized near the transcription start site of expressed genes. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of Wdr82 leads to decreased Setd1A expression and occupancy at transcription start sites and reduced histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation at these sites. However, neither RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) occupancy nor target gene expression levels are altered following Wdr82 depletion. Hence, Wdr82 is required for the targeting of Setd1A-mediated histone H3-Lys4 trimethylation near transcription start sites via tethering to RNA polymerase II, an event that is a consequence of transcription initiation. These results suggest a model for how the mammalian RNAP II machinery is linked with histone H3-Lys4 histone methyltransferase complexes at transcriptionally active genes.},

  abstract = {CpG-binding protein (CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1)) binds to DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs and is required for mammalian embryogenesis, normal cytosine methylation, and cellular differentiation. Studies were performed to identify proteins that interact with CFP1 to gain insight into the molecular function of this protein. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry reveal that human CFP1 associates with a ∼450-kDa complex that contains the mammalian homologues of six of the seven components of the Set1/COMPASS complex, the sole histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase in yeast. In vitro assays demonstrate that the human Set1/CFP1 complex is a histone methyltransferase that produces mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys4. Confocal microscopy reveals that CFP1 and Set1 co-localize to nuclear speckles associated with euchromatin. A Set1 complex of reduced mass persists in murine embryonic stem cells lacking CFP1. These cells carry elevated levels of methylated histone H3-Lys4 and reduced levels of methylated histone H3-Lys9. Together with the previous finding of reduced levels of cytosine methylation, these data indicate that cells lacking CFP1 contain reduced levels of heterochromatin. Furthermore, ES cells lacking CFP1 exhibit a 4-fold excess of histone H3-Lys4 methylation following induction of differentiation, indicating that CFP1 restricts the activity of the Set1 histone methyltransferase complex. These results reveal a mammalian counterpart to the yeast Set1/COMPASS complex. The presence of CFP1 in this complex implicates this protein as a critical epigenetic regulator of histone modification in addition to cytosine methylation and reveals one mechanism by which this protein intersects with the epigenetic machinery.},

These modifications are controlled by histone-modifying enzymes and read out by histone-binding proteins. Numerous proteins have been identified as histone modification readers. Here we report the family-wide characterization of histone binding abilities of human CW domain-containing proteins. We demonstrate that the CW domains in ZCWPW2 and MORC3/4 selectively recognize histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4, similar to ZCWPW1 reported previously, while the MORC1/2 and LSD2 lack histone H3 Lys-4 binding ability. Our crystal structures of the CW domains of ZCWPW2 and MORC3 in complex with the histone H3 trimethylated at Lys-4 peptide reveal the molecular basis of this interaction. In each complex, two tryptophan residues in the CW domain form the “floor” and “right wall,” respectively, of the methyllysine recognition cage. Our mutation results based on ZCWPW2 reveal that the right wall tryptophan residue is essential for binding, and the floor tryptophan residue enhances binding affinity. Our structural and mutational analysis highlights the conserved roles of the cage residues of CW domain across the histone methyllysine binders but also suggests why some CW domains lack histone binding ability.},

Preliminary results suggest that this kallikrein may play a role in testis function in adult mice. In order to obtain insights into its physiological functions, we undertook molecular and biochemical analyses of this enzyme. We cloned a cDNA for kallikrein 24 from the adult mouse testis cDNA library. Kallikrein 24 was expressed in the kidney, submandibular glands, ovary, epididymis, and testis of the mouse. In the testis, kallikrein 24 mRNA was detectable at 4 weeks of postnatal development, and became more prominent thereafter. The kallikrein 24 gene was expressed exclusively in the Leydig cells of adult mice. When Leydig cells isolated from a 2-week-old mouse testis were cultured in the presence of testosterone, kallikrein 24 expression was induced. Active recombinant enzyme showed trypsin-like specificity, favorably cleaving Arg-X bonds of synthetic peptide substrates. The enzymatic activity was strongly inhibited by typical serine protease inhibitors. Mouse kallikrein 24 degraded casein, gelatin, fibronectin and laminin. These results suggest that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins in the interstitial area surrounding the Leydig cells of the adult mouse testis. The present findings should contribute to future physiological studies of this mouse testis protease.},

The c-fms gene is expressed in macrophage, trophoblast cell lineages, and to some extent granulocytes. A reporter gene construct containing 3.5-kb of 5′ flanking sequence and the downstream intron 2 of the c-fms gene directed expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to cells expressing the c-fms gene including the macrophages and trophoblasts. EGFP was detected in trophoblasts from the earliest stage of implantation. During embryonic development, EGFP expression highlighted the large numbers of c-fms positive macrophages in most organs. These embryonic macrophages contribute to organogenesis and tissue remodeling. In adult c-fms EGFP transgenic mice, which have been called the MacGreen mice, EGFP expressed in all tissue macrophage populations and permitted convenient detection of tissue macrophages as well as facilitates their isolation from various tissues.},

Their trophic roles for other cell types in development and homeostasis are becoming increasingly evident. The receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1R) is expressed in a large proportion of cells considered to be mononuclear phagocytes, including antigen-presenting dendritic cells, which can be considered a specialized adaptive state rather than a separate lineage. The unity of the MPS is challenged by evidence that there is a separate embryonic phagocyte lineage, by the transdifferentiation and fusion of MPS cells with other cell types, and by evidence of local renewal of tissue macrophage populations as opposed to monocyte recruitment.

Beyond classical immune functions, they have been shown to be important for organogenesis, spermatogenesis, and male hormone production. In the adult testis, two different macrophage populations have been identified based on their distinct tissue localization and morphology, but their developmental origin and mode of homeostatic maintenance are unknown. In this study, we use genetic lineage–tracing models and adoptive transfer protocols to address this question. We show that embryonic progenitors give rise to the interstitial macrophage population, whereas peritubular macrophages are exclusively seeded postnatally in the prepuberty period from bone marrow (BM)–derived progenitors. As the proliferative capacity of interstitial macrophages declines, BM progenitors also contribute to this population. Once established, both the peritubular and interstitial macrophage populations exhibit a long life span and a low turnover in the steady state. Our observations identify distinct developmental pathways for two different tMφ populations that have important implications for the further dissection of their distinct roles in organ homeostasis and testicular function.},

  abstract = {Summary: The production, differentiation, and presence of male gametes represent inimitable challenges to the immune system, as they are unique to the body and appear long after the maturation of the immune system and formation of systemic self-tolerance. Known to protect germ cells and foreign tissue grafts from autoimmune attack, the ‘immune privilege’ of the testis was originally, and somewhat simplistically, attributed to the existence of the blood–testis barrier. Recent research has shown a previously unknown level of complexity with a multitude of factors, both physical and immunological, necessary for the establishment and maintenance of the immunotolerance in the testis. Besides the blood–testis barrier and a diminished capability of the large testicular resident macrophage population to mount an inflammatory response, it is the constitutive expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the testis by immune and particularly somatic cells, that represents an essential element for local immunosuppression. The role of androgens in testicular immune regulation has long been underestimated; yet, accumulating evidence now shows that they orchestrate the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression and shift cytokine balance toward a tolerogenic environment. Furthermore, the role of the testicular dendritic cells in suppressing antigen-specific immunity and T-lymphocyte activation is discussed. Finally, the active role mast cells play in the induction and amplification of immune responses, both in infertile humans and in experimental models, highlights the importance of preventing mast cell activation to maintain the immune-privileged status of the testis.},

A striking feature is the presence of nine highly conserved, potentially charged residues in the transmembrane helices. Previous models have attempted to explain assembly based on pairwise interactions of these residues. Using a novel method for the isolation of intact radiolabeled protein complexes, we demonstrate that one basic and two acidic transmembrane residues are required for the assembly of each of the three signaling dimers with the TCR. This remarkable three-helix arrangement applies to all three assembly steps and represents the organizing principle for the formation of this intricate receptor structure.},

The MS4A family includes CD20, FcεRIβ, HTm4 and at least 26 novel members that are characterized by their structural features: with four membrane-spanning domains, two extracellular domains and two cytoplasmic regions. CD20, FcεRIβ and HTm4 have been found to function in B cells, mast cells and hematopoietic cells respectively. However, little is known about the function of MS4a4B in T cell regulation. We demonstrate here that MS4a4B negatively regulates mouse T cell proliferation. MS4a4B is highly expressed in primary T cells, natural killer cells (NK) and some T cell lines. But its expression in all malignant T cells, including thymoma and T hybridoma tested, was silenced. Interestingly, its expression was regulated during T cell activation. Viral vector-driven overexpression of MS4a4B in primary T cells and EL4 thymoma cells reduced cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of MS4a4B accelerated T cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis showed that MS4a4B regulated T cell proliferation by inhibiting entry of the cells into S-G2/M phase. MS4a4B-mediated inhibition of cell cycle was correlated with upregulation of Cdk inhibitory proteins and decreased levels of Cdk2 activity, subsequently leading to inhibition of cell cycle progression. Our data indicate that MS4a4B negatively regulates T cell proliferation. MS4a4B, therefore, may serve as a modulator in the negative-feedback regulatory loop of activated T cells},

  abstract = {Although the Brn-3a and Brn-3b POU family transcription factors were originally identified in neuronal cells, their expression in some non neuronal cell types has previously been reported. Here we report that Brn-3a and Brn-3b are also expressed in the testis with expression of each factor being observed at distinct stages of germ cell development. Thus, Brn-3a is expressed in spermatogonia whereas Brn-3b expression is observed in post-meiotic spermatids. In agreement with this, Brn-3a expression is detectable much earlier than that of Brn-3b in testes derived from sexually immature postnatal animals. Similarly, Brn-3b expression is absent in knock out mice lacking a functional CREM transcription factor in which the later stages of germ cell development do not occur, whereas Brn-3a expression is observed at similar levels in the testes of these knock out mice. Interestingly, the cellular pattern of Brn-3a expression during germ cell development coincides with that of the BRCA-1 anti-oncogene. Consistent with the possibility that Brn-3a may regulate expression of BRCA-1 in the testis, we have shown that Brn-3a can strongly activate the BRCA-1 promoter in co-transfection experiments whereas Brn-3b does not have this effect. Hence, as observed in neuronal cells, Brn-3a and Brn-3b may play distinct and important functional roles in the regulation of gene expression during germ cell development.},

During embryogenesis,Esx1expression was restricted to extraembryonic tissues, including the endoderm of the visceral yolk sac, the ectoderm of the chorion, and subsequently the labyrinthine trophoblast of the chorioallantoic placenta. In adult tissues,Esx1expression was detected only in testes. However,Esx1transcripts were not detected in the testes of sterileW/Wvmice, suggesting thatEsx1expression is restricted to male germ cells.In situhybridization experiments of testes indicated thatEsx1transcripts were most abundant in pre- and postmeiotic germ cells. Hybridization experiments suggested thatEsx1was conserved among vertebrates, including amphibians, birds, and mammals. During mouse development, the paternally derived X chromosome is preferentially inactivated in extraembryonic tissues of XX embryos, including the trophoblast, visceral endoderm, and parietal endoderm. In addition, the X chromosome is transiently inactivated during the meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Thus, the identification ofEsx1provides a molecular entry point into a genetic pathway to understand X chromosome-regulated fetal–maternal interactions and male germ cell development.},

We map the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages.

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis is the process by which male gametes are formed from a self-renewing population of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) residing in the testis. SSCs represent less than 1\% of the total testicular cell population in adults, but must achieve a stable balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Once differentiation has occurred, the newly formed and highly proliferative spermatogonia must then enter the meiotic program in which DNA content is doubled, then halved twice to create haploid gametes. While much is known about the critical cellular processes that take place during the specialized cell division that is meiosis, much less is known about how the spermatocytes in the “first-wave” in juveniles compare to those that contribute to long-term, “steady-state” spermatogenesis in adults. Given the strictly-defined developmental process of spermatogenesis, this study explored the transcriptional profiles of developmental cell stages during testis maturation. Using a combination of comprehensive germ cell sampling with high-resolution, single-cell-mRNA-sequencing, we have generated a reference dataset of germ cell gene expression. We show that discrete developmental stages of spermatogenesis possess significant differences in the transcriptional profiles from neonates compared to juveniles and adults. Importantly, these gene expression dynamics are also reflected at the protein level in their respective cell types. We also show differential utilization of many biological pathways with age in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes, demonstrating significantly different underlying gene regulatory programs in these cell types over the course of testis development and spermatogenic waves. This dataset represents the first unbiased sampling of spermatogonia and spermatocytes during testis maturation, at high-resolution, single-cell depth. Not only does this analysis reveal previously unknown transcriptional dynamics of a highly transitional cell population, it has also begun to reveal critical differences in biological pathway utilization in developing spermatogonia and spermatocytes, including response to DNA damage and double-strand breaks.},

  abstract = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play important roles in repressing lineage-specific genes and maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, how PcG proteins are recruited to their target genes is largely unknown. Here, we show that the H3K36-specific histone demethylase Kdm2b is highly expressed in mESCs and regulated by the pluripotent factors Oct4 and Sox2 directly. Depletion of Kdm2b in mESCs causes de-repression of lineage-specific genes and induces early differentiation. The function of Kdm2b depends on its CxxC-ZF domain, which mediates its genome-wide binding to CpG islands (CGIs). Kdm2b interacts with the core components of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and recruits the complex to the CGIs of early lineage-specific genes. Thus, our study not only reveals an Oct4–Sox2–Kdm2b–PRC1–CGI regulatory axis and its function in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mESCs, but also demonstrates a critical function of Kdm2b in recruiting PRC1 to the CGIs of lineage-specific genes to repress their expression.},

This modification creates a binding site for MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain) proteins which target chromatin-modifying activities that are thought to contribute to transcriptional repression and maintain heterochromatic regions of the genome. In contrast with DNA methylation, which is found broadly across vertebrate genomes, non-methylated DNA is concentrated in regions known as CGIs (CpG islands). Recently, a family of proteins which encode a ZF-CxxC (zinc finger-CxxC) domain have been shown to specifically recognize non-methylated DNA and recruit chromatin-modifying activities to CGI elements. For example, CFP1 (CxxC finger protein 1), MLL (mixed lineage leukaemia protein), KDM (lysine demethylase) 2A and KDM2B regulate lysine methylation on histone tails, whereas TET (ten-eleven translocation) 1 and TET3 hydroxylate methylated cytosine bases. In the present review, we discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of how ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins recognize non-methylated DNA and describe their role in chromatin modification at CGIs.},

We found male-specific sterility in the CR16-knockout mice. The sperms of the CR16-knockout mice had abnormal head morphology, and greatly diminished fertilization ability in in vitro fertilization experiments. CR16 and N-WASP were localized to the actin filaments at the Sertoli cell–spermatid junctions (SspJs). The level of N-WASP but not the transcript was decreased in the testes and Sertoli cells of the CR16-knockout mice.

Although the functions of hTIF2 and of its mouse homolog (GRIP1 or mTIF2) have been clearly established in vitro, their physiological role remains elusive. Here, we have generated mice lacking mTIF2/GRIP1 and examined their phenotype with a particular emphasis on reproductive functions. TIF2−/− mice are viable, but the fertility of both sexes is impaired. Male hypofertility is due to defects in both spermiogenesis (teratozoospermia) and age-dependent testicular degeneration, and TIF2 expression appears to be essential for adhesion of Sertoli cells to germ cells. Female hypofertility is due to a placental hypoplasia that most probably reflects a requirement for maternal TIF2 in decidua stromal cells that face the developing placenta. We conclude that TIF2 plays a critical role in mouse reproductive functions, whereas previous reports have not revealed serious fertility impairment in SRC-1−/− or p/CIP−/− mutants. Thus, even though the three p160 coactivators exhibit strong sequence homology and similar activity in assays in vitro, they play distinct physiological roles in vivo, as their genetic eliminations result in distinct pathologies.},

Inactivation of Nxf2, a germ cell-specific gene, causes defects in spermatogenesis. Here we report that Nxf3 is expressed exclusively in Sertoli cells of the postnatal testis, in a developmentally regulated manner. Expression of Nxf3 coincides with the cessation of Sertoli cell proliferation and the beginning of their differentiation. Continued expression of Nxf3 in mature Sertoli cells of the adult is spermatogenesis stage-independent. Nxf3 is not essential for spermatogenesis, however, suggesting functional redundancy among Nxf family members. With its unique expression pattern in the testis, the promoter of Nxf3 can be used to drive postnatal Sertoli cell-specific expression of other proteins such as Cre recombinase. Mol. Reprod.

In gonadal cells, this conserved pathway is crucial for genome defense, and its main function is to silence transposable elements. This is achieved through posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene silencing. Precursors that give rise to piRNAs require specialized transcription and transport machineries because piRNA biogenesis is a cytoplasmic process. The ping-pong cycle, a posttranscriptional silencing mechanism, combines the cleavage-dependent silencing of transposon RNAs with piRNA production. PIWI proteins also function in the nucleus, where they scan for nascent target transcripts with sequence complementarity, instructing transcriptional silencing and deposition of repressive chromatin marks at transposon loci. Although studies have revealed numerous factors that participate in each branch of the piRNA pathway, the precise molecular roles of these factors often remain unclear. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in piRNA biogenesis and function.},

This canonical cell cycle-associated activity is also crucial for fertility as it allows the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells within the reproductive organs to generate meiotically competent cells. Intriguingly, several CDKs exhibit meiosis-specific functions and are essential for the completion of the two reductional meiotic divisions required to generate haploid gametes. These meiosis-specific functions are mediated by both known CDK/cyclin complexes and meiosis-specific CDK-regulators and are important for a variety of processes during meiotic prophase. The majority of meiotic defects observed upon deletion of these proteins occur during the extended prophase I of the first meiotic division. Importantly a lack of redundancy is seen within the meiotic arrest phenotypes described for many of these proteins, suggesting intricate layers of cell cycle control are required for normal meiotic progression. Using the process of male germ cell development (spermatogenesis) as a reference, this review seeks to highlight the diverse roles of selected CDKs their activators, and their regulators during gametogenesis.},

We have isolated cDNAs that encode a murine B-type cyclin, which has been designated cycB1. cycB1 was shown to be expressed in several adult tissues and in the midgestation mouse embryo. In the adult tissues, the highest levels of cycB1 transcripts were seen in the testis and ovary, which contain germ cells at various stages of differentiation. The major transcripts corresponding to cycB1 are 1.7 and 2.5 kb, with the 1.7 kb species being the predominant testicular transcript and the 2.5 kb species more abundant in the ovary. Examination of cDNAs corresponding to the 2.5 kb and 1.7 kb mRNAs revealed that these transcripts encode identical proteins, differing only in the polyadenylation signal used and therefore in the length of their 3′ untranslated regions. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the predominant sites of cycB1 expression in the testis and ovary were in the germinal compartment, particularly in early round spermatids in the testis and growing oocytes in the ovary. Thus cycB1 is expressed in both meiotic and postmeiotic cells. This pattern of cycB1 expression further suggests that cycB1 may have different functions in the two cell types, only one of which correlates with progression of the cell cycle. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A cDNA encoding the murine cyclin B2 (cycB2) was isolated from an adult mouse testis cDNA library as part of studies designed to identify cyclins involved in murine germ cell development. This cycB2 cDNA was then used to examine the pattern of cycB2 expression during male and female germ cell development and in early embryogenesis, and to compare this expression with the previously characterized expression of cycB1. A single 1.7 kb cycB2 transcript was detected by northern blot hybridization analysis of total RNA isolated from midgestation embryos and various adult tissues. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that cycB2 expression in the testis was most abundant in the germ cells, specifically in pachytene spermatocytes. This is in contrast to the highest levels of expression of cycB1 being present in early spermatids. In situ analysis of the ovary revealed cycB2 transcripts in both germ cells and somatic cells, specifically in the oocytes and granulosa cells of growing and mature follicles. The pattern of cycB1 and cycB2 expression in ovulated and fertilized eggs was also examined. While the steady state level of cycB1 and cycB2 signal remained constant in oocytes and ovulated eggs, signal of both appeared to decrease following fertilization. In addition, both cycB1 and cycB2 transcripts were detected in the cells of the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm of the blastocyst. These results demonstrate that there are lineage- and developmental-specific differences in the pattern of the B cyclins in mammalian germ cells, in contrast to the co-expression of B cyclins in the early conceptus.},

Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a~priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell~transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes.

Subjecting \textasciitilde{}100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered differential activation of the branches across hits, including an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and IRE1α.

Our experiments distinguish cell activation versus differentiation in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate that these two processes are tightly coupled and are jointly controlled by many transcription factors, metabolic genes, and cytokine/receptor pairs. There are only a small number of genes regulating differentiation without any role in activation. By combining biochemical and genetic data, we provide an atlas for Th2 differentiation, validating known regulators and identifying factors, such as Pparg and Bhlhe40, as part of the core regulatory network governing Th2 helper cell fates.},

Several computational methods are available to score gene essentiality, and recent progress has been made in defining essentiality in the non-coding genome. Haploinsufficiency is emerging as a critical aspect of gene essentiality: approximately 3,000 human genes cannot tolerate loss of one of the two alleles. Genes identified as essential in human cell lines or knockout mice may be distinct from those in living humans. Reconciling these discrepancies in how we evaluate gene essentiality has applications in clinical genetics and may offer insights for drug development.},

We identified the majority of known genes and pathways involved in these processes, as well as a plethora of genes with unidentified roles.

Here we develop pooled CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear primate-specific. Through editing of primary human progenitors and mouse transgenesis, we validate the BCL11A erythroid enhancer as a target for HbF reinduction.

We develop Mosaic-seq to systematically perturb enhancers and measure their endogenous activities at single-cell resolution. Mosaic-seq uses a CRISPR barcoding system to jointly measure a cell's transcriptome and its sgRNA modulators, thus quantifying the effects of dCas9-KRAB-mediated enhancer repression in single cells. Applying Mosaic-seq to 71 constituent enhancers from 15 super-enhancers, our analysis of 51,448 sgRNA-induced transcriptomes finds that only a small number of constituents are major effectors of target gene expression. Binding of p300 and RNAPII are key features of these constituents. We determine two key parameters of enhancer activity in single cells: their penetrance in a population and their contribution to expression in these cells. Through combinatorial interrogation, we find that simultaneous repression of multiple weak constituents can alter super-enhancer activity in a manner greatly exceeding repression of individual constituents.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, assigning specific functions to noncoding sequences remains a major challenge. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems have emerged as a powerful approach for targeted genome and epigenome perturbation. CRISPR systems are now harnessed for high-throughput screening of the noncoding genome to uncover functional regulatory elements and to define their precise functions with superior speed. Here, we summarize the various tools developed for such screens in mammalian systems, discuss screening methods and technical considerations, highlight screens that are already transforming our understanding of gene regulation and disease mechanisms, consider the impact of such discoveries on the development of new therapeutics, and provide our viewpoint on the challenges for future development of the field.},

Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.},

Mapping of genetic interactions (GIs) is usually based on cell fitness as the phenotypic readout, which obscures the mechanistic origin of interactions. Norman et al. developed a framework for mapping and understanding GIs. This approach leverages high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data gathered from CRISPR-mediated, pooled perturbation screens. Diverse transcriptomic phenotypes construct a “manifold” representing all possible states of the cell. Each perturbation and GI projects the cell state to a particular position on this manifold, enabling unbiased ordering of genes in pathways and systematic classifications of GIs.
Science, this issue p. 786
How cellular and organismal complexity emerges from combinatorial expression of genes is a central question in biology. High-content phenotyping approaches such as Perturb-seq (single-cell RNA-sequencing pooled CRISPR screens) present an opportunity for exploring such genetic interactions (GIs) at scale. Here, we present an analytical framework for interpreting high-dimensional landscapes of cell states (manifolds) constructed from transcriptional phenotypes. We applied this approach to Perturb-seq profiling of strong GIs mined from a growth-based, gain-of-function GI map. Exploration of this manifold enabled ordering of regulatory pathways, principled classification of GIs (e.g., identifying suppressors), and mechanistic elucidation of synergistic interactions, including an unexpected synergy between CBL and CNN1 driving erythroid differentiation. Finally, we applied recommender system machine learning to predict interactions, facilitating exploration of vastly larger GI manifolds.

Two-dimensional gel analysis and dephosphorylation experiments revealed that the two stereoisomers of RA differentially regulate the phosphorylation status of the Stra8 protein, which was shown to exist in differently phosphorylated forms. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry studies showed that the Stra8 protein is cytoplasmic. During mouse embryogenesis, Stra8 expression was restricted to the male developing gonads, and in adult mice, the expression of Stra8 was restricted to the premeiotic germ cells.

Recently, it has been shown that the c-kit proto-oncogene is encoded at the white spotting (W) locus in mice. Mutations of this gene cause depletion of germ cells, some hematopoietic cells and melanocytes. In order to define further the role of c-kit in gametogenesis, we have examined its expression in late fetal and postnatal ovaries and in postnatal testis. By RNA blot analysis, c-kit transcripts were not detected in late fetal ovaries but appeared at birth. The relative amount reached a maximum in ovaries of juvenile mice, and decreased in adult ovaries. c-kit transcripts were present in increasing amounts in isolated primordial, growing and full-grown oocytes, as well as in ovulated eggs. Little was detected in early 2-cell embryos and none in blastocysts. In situ hybridization revealed c-kit transcripts in a few oocytes of late fetal ovaries and in all oocytes (from primordial to full-grown) in ovaries from juvenile and adult mice. Expression was also observed in ovarian interstitial tissue from 14 days of age onward. Using indirect immunofluorescence, the c-kit protein was detected on the surface of primordial, growing and full-grown oocytes, as well as on embryos at the 1- and 2-cell stages; little remained in blastocysts. In situ hybridization analysis of testes from mice of different ages demonstrated expression in spermatogonia from 6 days of age onward. Using information provided by determining the stage of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium for a given tubule and by following the age dependence of labeling, it was concluded that the period of expression of c-kit extends from at least as early as type A2 spermatogonia through type B spermatogonia and into preleptotene spermatocytes. Leydig cells were labelled at all ages examined. The expression pattern in oocytes correlates most strongly with oocyte growth and in male germ cells with gonial proliferation.},

  abstract = {The transition from mitosis to meiosis is a defining juncture in the life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms. In yeast, the decision to enter meiosis is made before the single round of DNA replication that precedes the two meiotic divisions1. We present genetic evidence of an analogous decision point in the germ line of a multicellular organism. The mouse Stra8 gene is expressed in germ cells of embryonic ovaries, where meiosis is initiated, but not in those of embryonic testes, where meiosis does not begin until after birth2. Here we report that in female embryos lacking Stra8 gene function, the early, mitotic development of germ cells is normal, but these cells then fail to undergo premeiotic DNA replication, meiotic chromosome condensation, cohesion, synapsis and recombination. Combined with previous findings, these genetic data suggest that active differentiation of ovarian germ cells commences at a regulatory point upstream of premeiotic DNA replication.},

Recent studies have shown that the dominant white spotting (W) locus encodes the proto-oncogene c-kit, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family. One symptom of mice bearing mutation within this gene is sterility due to developmental failure of the primordial germ cells during early embryogenesis. To elucidate the role of the c-kit in gametogenesis, we used an anti-c-kit monoclonal antibody, ACK2, as an antagonistic blocker for c-kit function to interfere with the development of male and female germ cells during postnatal life. ACK2 enabled us to detect the expression of c-kit in the gonadal tissue and also to determine the functional status of c-kit, which is expressed on the surface of a particular cell lineage. Consistent with our immunohistochemical findings, the intravenous injection of ACK2 into adult mice caused a depletion in the differentiating type A spermatogonia from the testis during 24–36 h, while the undifferentiated type A spermatogonia were basically unaffected. Intraperitoneal injections of ACK2 into prepuberal mice could completely block the mitosis of mature (differentiating) type A spermatogonia, but not the mitosis of the gonocytes and primitive type A spermatogonia, or the meiosis of spermatocytes. Our results indicate that the survival and/or proliferation of the differentiating type A spermatogonia requires c-kit, but the primitive (undifferentiated) type A spermatogonia or spermatogenic stem cells are independent from c-kit. Moreover, the antibody administration had no significant effect on oocyte maturation despite its intense expression of c-kit.},

Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of retinol (vitamin A), functions as a ligand for nuclear RA receptors (RARs) that regulate development of chordate animals. RA-RARs can activate or repress transcription of key developmental genes. Genetic studies in mouse and zebrafish embryos that are deficient in RA-generating enzymes or RARs have been instrumental in identifying RA functions, revealing that RA signaling regulates development of many organs and tissues, including the body axis, spinal cord, forelimbs, heart, eye and reproductive tract. An understanding of the normal functions of RA signaling during development will guide efforts for use of RA as a therapeutic agent to improve human health.

  abstract = {Male mouse sex cells mature into sperm through a 35-d process punctuated by four transitions, two occurring before meiosis (spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation) and two after meiosis (spermatid elongation and sperm release). The four transitions occur in proximity spatially and temporally, with an 8.6-d periodicity. We describe how this coordination is achieved. The premeiotic transitions were known to be regulated by retinoic acid (RA). We show that RA also regulates the two postmeiotic transitions. RA levels change periodically, and meiotic cells contribute to its production. The two postmeiotic transitions require RA from meiotic cells while the premeiotic transitions require RA from somatic cells. These elements underpin the spatiotemporal coordination of spermatogenesis to ensure constant sperm production throughout adult life., Mammalian spermatogenesis is an elaborately organized differentiation process, starting with diploid spermatogonia, which include germ-line stem cells, and ending with haploid spermatozoa. The process involves four pivotal transitions occurring in physical proximity: spermatogonial differentiation, meiotic initiation, initiation of spermatid elongation, and release of spermatozoa. We report how the four transitions are coordinated in mice. Two premeiotic transitions, spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation, were known to be coregulated by an extrinsic signal, retinoic acid (RA). Our chemical manipulations of RA levels in mouse testes now reveal that RA also regulates the two postmeiotic transitions: initiation of spermatid elongation and spermatozoa release. We measured RA concentrations and found that they changed periodically, as also reflected in the expression patterns of an RA-responsive gene, STRA8; RA levels were low before the four transitions, increased when the transitions occurred, and remained elevated thereafter. We found that pachytene spermatocytes, which express an RA-synthesizing enzyme, Aldh1a2, contribute directly and significantly to RA production in testes. Indeed, chemical and genetic depletion of pachytene spermatocytes revealed that RA from pachytene spermatocytes was required for the two postmeiotic transitions, but not for the two premeiotic transitions. We conclude that the premeiotic transitions are coordinated by RA from Sertoli (somatic) cells. Once germ cells enter meiosis, pachytene spermatocytes produce RA to coordinate the two postmeiotic transitions. In combination, these elements underpin the spatiotemporal coordination of spermatogenesis and ensure its prodigious output in adult males.},

requirement for vitamin A in reproduction and development was first determined from studies of nutritional deficiencies. Subsequent research has shown that embryonic development and both male and female reproduction are modulated by retinoic acid (RA), the active form of vitamin A. Because RA is active in multiple developmental systems, its synthesis, transport, and degradation are tightly regulated in different tissues. A growing body of evidence implicates RA as a requirement for the initiation of meiosis in both male and female mammals, resulting in a mechanistic model involving the interplay of RA, RA synthesis enzymes, RA receptors, and degradative cytochrome P450 enzymes in this system. Recently, that model has been challenged, prompting a review of the established paradigm. While it remains possible that additional molecules may be involved in regulating entry into meiosis, the weight of evidence supporting a key role for RA is incontrovertible., This review summarizes the evidence that supports a role for retinoic acid in meiotic initiation in both sexes.},

KAP showed phosphatase activity toward substrates containing either phosphotyrosine or phosphoserine residues. Since KAP is not significantly similar to known phosphatases beyond the catalytic core motif, it represents an additional class of dual specificity phosphatase.

Upon the completion of spindle attachment, formation of the CMT2–MAD2 complex coincides with dissociation of the p55CDC–MAD2 complex. Overexpression of CMT2 in cells arrested by the spindle checkpoint causes premature destruction of securin and allows exit from mitosis without chromosome segregation. Depletion of CMT2 induces cell death following a transient delay in the onset of anaphase.

  abstract = {Accurate segregation of chromosomes in mitosis is ensured by a surveillance mechanism called the mitotic (or spindle assembly) checkpoint. It prevents sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle through their kinetochores. The checkpoint acts by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that targets for degradation securin, an inhibitor of anaphase initiation. The activity of APC/C is inhibited by a mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), composed of the APC/C activator Cdc20 bound to the checkpoint proteins MAD2, BubR1, and Bub3. When all kinetochores acquire bipolar attachment the checkpoint is inactivated, but the mechanisms of checkpoint inactivation are not understood. We have previously observed that hydrolyzable ATP is required for exit from checkpoint-arrested state. In this investigation we examined the possibility that ATP hydrolysis in exit from checkpoint is linked to the action of the Mad2-binding protein p31comet in this process. It is known that p31comet prevents the formation of a Mad2 dimer that it thought to be important for turning on the mitotic checkpoint. This explains how p31comet blocks the activation of the checkpoint but not how it promotes its inactivation. Using extracts from checkpoint-arrested cells and MCC isolated from such extracts, we now show that p31comet causes the disassembly of MCC and that this process requires β,γ-hydrolyzable ATP. Although p31comet binds to Mad2, it promotes the dissociation of Cdc20 from BubR1 in MCC.},

Although classical experiments indicate that accumulation of mitotic cyclins drives the G2/M transition in embryonic cells, the trigger for mitotic entry in somatic cells remains unknown. We report here that synergistic action of Bora and Aurora A controls the G2/M transition. Bora accumulates in G2 and promotes Aurora A-mediated activation of the Plk1 kinase, leading to the Cdk1 activation and mitotic entry. Mechanistically, Bora interacts with Plk1 and controls the accessibility of its activation loop for phosphorylation and activation by Aurora A. Thus, the Aurora A-Bora-Plk1 pathway controls the Cdk1 activation at mitotic entry and defines a mechanism for one of the most important, and yet ill-defined events in the cell cycle.},

Ever since its first observation under the microscope over a century ago, mitosis—the process wherein a cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells—has captured the attention of biologists and physicians alike owing to its beauty, sophistication, and importance for the life cycle of eukaryotic organisms. The key factors that control mitosis primarily do so through protein phosphorylation and regulated degradation. In this review, which contains six figures, one table, and 432 references, we discuss the mechanisms by which only a handful of mitotic protein kinases control various mitotic events in distinct spatiotemporal contexts. We highlight the central role in this control of the two-tiered Aurora-PLK1 cascades that are organized by several multifunctional scaffold proteins and integrated within larger mitotic regulatory networks.
Mitosis is controlled by reversible protein phosphorylation involving specific kinases and phosphatases. A handful of major mitotic protein kinases, such as the cyclin B–CDK1 complex, the Aurora kinases, and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), cooperatively regulate distinct mitotic processes. Research has identified proteins and mechanisms that integrate these kinases into signaling cascades that guide essential mitotic events. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of mitotic regulation and may advance the development of novel antimitotic drugs. We review collected evidence that in vertebrates, the Aurora kinases serve as catalytic subunits of distinct complexes formed with the four scaffold proteins Bora, CEP192, INCENP, and TPX2, which we deem “core” Aurora cofactors. These complexes and the Aurora-PLK1 cascades organized by Bora, CEP192, and INCENP control crucial aspects of mitosis and all pathways of spindle assembly. We compare the mechanisms of Aurora activation in relation to the different spindle assembly pathways and draw a functional analogy between the CEP192 complex and the chromosomal passenger complex that may reflect the coevolution of centrosomes, kinetochores, and the actomyosin cleavage apparatus. We also analyze the roles and mechanisms of Aurora-PLK1 signaling in the cell and centrosome cycles and in the DNA damage response.
Precise spatiotemporal control enables the mitotic kinases Aurora and PLK1 to orchestrate distinct mitotic processes.

The response gene to complement 32 (RGC32) at 13q14.11 was identified as a deletion target, and its expression was frequently silenced in glioma cell lines compared with normal brain. Levels of RGC32 mRNA tended to decrease toward higher grades of primary astrocytomas, especially in tumors with mutations of p53. Expression of RGC32 mRNA was dramatically increased by exogenous p53 in a p53-mutant glioma cell line, and also by endogenous p53 in response to DNA damage in p53+/+ colon-cancer cells, but not in isogenic p53−/− cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated binding of endogenous p53 protein to the promoter region of the RGC32 gene, implying p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Transiently and stably overexpressed RGC32 suppressed the growth of glioma cells, probably owing to induction of G2/M arrest. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a concentration of RGC32 protein at the centrosome during mitosis. RGC32 formed a protein complex with polo-like kinase 1 and was phosphorylated in vitro. These observations implied a novel mechanism by which p53 might negatively regulate cell-cycle progression by way of this newly identified transcriptional target. Our results provide the first evidence that RGC32 might be a possible tumor-suppressor for glioma, that it is directly induced by p53, and that it mediates the arrest of mitotic progression.},

Fizzy-related 1 (FZR1) is an activator of the Anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and an important regulator of the mitotic cell division cycle. Using a germ-cell-specific conditional knockout model we examined its role in entry into meiosis and early meiotic events in both sexes. Loss of APC/CFZR1 activity in the male germline led to both a mitotic and a meiotic testicular defect resulting in infertility due to the absence of mature spermatozoa. Spermatogonia in the prepubertal testes of such mice had abnormal proliferation and delayed entry into meiosis. Although early recombination events were initiated, male germ cells failed to progress beyond zygotene and underwent apoptosis. Loss of APC/CFZR1 activity was associated with raised cyclin B1 levels, suggesting that CDK1 may trigger apoptosis. By contrast, female FZR1Δ mice were subfertile, with premature onset of ovarian failure by 5 months of age. Germ cell loss occurred embryonically in the ovary, around the time of the zygotene-pachytene transition, similar to that observed in males. In addition, the transition of primordial follicles into the growing follicle pool in the neonatal ovary was abnormal, such that the primordial follicles were prematurely depleted. We conclude that APC/CFZR1 is an essential regulator of spermatogonial proliferation and early meiotic prophase I in both male and female germ cells and is therefore important in establishing the reproductive health of adult male and female mammals.},

In this paper, the existence of two A-type cyclins in the mouse is demonstrated. In the adult mouse, the expression of cyclin A1, which has greatest sequence identity with Xenopus cyclin A1, is restricted to germ cells. In contrast cyclin A2, which has greatest sequence identity with human cyclin A and Xenopus cyclin A2, is expressed in all tissues analysed. In order to explore the function of cyclin A1 in germ cells, its expression during the meiotic cell cycle and its associated kinase subunits have been characterised in the testis. The levels of cyclin A1 mRNA rise dramatically in late pachytene spermatocytes and become undetectable soon after completion of the meiotic divisions; thus its expression is cell cycle regulated. In lysates of germ cells from adult testes, cyclin A1 is present in p13suc1 precipitates, and cyclin A1 immunoprecipitates possess histone H1 kinase activity. Three kinase partners of cyclin A1 were identified: p34cdc2, a polypeptide of 39 × 10(3) M(r) that is related to p33cdk2 and, in lesser quantities, p33cdk2. Cyclin A1 was also detected in oocytes; in metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes, a proportion of the cyclin A1 colocalises with the spindle, possibly suggestive of a functional interaction. These data indicate that mammalian germ cells contain cyclin A1-dependent kinases that either act as a substitute for, or in addition to, the cyclin A2-dependent kinases characterised in somatic tissues.},

To investigate the role of cyclin A1 and possible redundancy among the cyclins  in vivo , we generated mice bearing a null mutation of  Ccna1. Ccna1-/- males were sterile due to a block of spermatogenesis before the first meiotic division, whereas females were normal. Meiosis arrest in  Ccna1–/– males was associated with increased germ cell apoptosis, desynapsis abnormalities and reduction of Cdc2 kinase activation at the end of meiotic prophase. Cyclin A1 is therefore essential for spermatocyte passage into the first meiotic division in male mice, a function that cannot be complemented by the concurrently expressed B-type cyclins.},

Within 10 years of their experiments, Watson and Crick deciphered its structure and yet another decade on the genetic code was cracked. However, the DNA story has already begun in 1869, with the young Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher. Having just completed his education as a physician, Miescher moved to Tübingen to work in the laboratory of biochemist Hoppe-Seyler, his aim being to elucidate the building blocks of life. Choosing leucocytes as his source material, he first investigated the proteins in these cells. However, during these experiments, he noticed a substance with unexpected properties that did not match those of proteins. Miescher had obtained the first crude purification of DNA. He further examined the properties and composition of this enigmatic substance and showed that it fundamentally differed from proteins. Due to its occurrence in the cells' nuclei, he termed the novel substance “nuclein”—a term still preserved in today's name deoxyribonucleic acid.},

In his experiments, Miescher noticed a precipitate of an unknown substance, which he characterised further. Its properties during the isolation procedure and its resistance to protease digestion indicated that the novel substance was not a protein or lipid. Analyses of its elementary composition revealed that, unlike proteins, it contained large amounts of phosphorous and, as Miescher confirmed later, lacked sulphur. Miescher recognised that he had discovered a novel molecule. Since he had isolated it from the cells’ nuclei he named it nuclein, a name preserved in today’s designation deoxyribonucleic acid. In subsequent work Miescher showed that nuclein was a characteristic component of all nuclei and hypothesised that it would prove to be inextricably linked to the function of this organelle. He suggested that its abundance in tissues might be related to their physiological status with increases in “nuclear substances” preceding cell division. Miescher even speculated that it might have a role in the transmission of hereditary traits, but subsequently rejected the idea. This article reviews the events and circumstances leading to Miescher’s discovery of DNA and places them within their historic context. It also tries to elucidate why it was Miescher who discovered DNA and why his name is not universally associated with this molecule today.},

  abstract = {The complete amino acid sequence of the basic nuclear protein of bull spermatozoa has been established. The sequence was partially deduced by characterization of peptides isolated from thermolysine and chymotryptic digests of the reduced and S-aminoethylated protein. The complete sequence of the first 37 residues was determined by Edman Begg degradation (Sequenator) of the protein. The amino acid sequence of the last 8 residues was determined by manual Edman degradation of an octapeptide obtained on cleavage of the reduced and S-methylated protein with N-bromosuccinimide. The basic nuclear protein of bull spermatozoa contains 47 amino acid residues with alanine at the amino terminus and glutamine at the carboxyl terminus. The protein contains 24 arginine residues and 6 half-cystine residues. 19 of the arginine residues are in the middle of the molecule, arranged in three clusters of, respectively, 7, 6 and 6 residues. Of the 6 half-cystine residues 2 are present in the amino-terminal region and 2 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule. The half-cystine residues are responsible for the cross-linking of the deoxyribonucleoprotein molecules which gives the mature sperm nucleus an unusual resistance towards chemical and mechanical damage. The complete amino acid sequence is: H2N-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Arg-(Cys)2-Leu-Thr His Ser-Gly-Ser-Arg-Cys-(Arg)7-Cys-(Arg)5-Phe-Gly-(Arg)5-Val-Cys-Tyr-Thr- Val-Ile-Arg-Cys-Thr-Arg-Gln.},

A model is proposed for the structure of this DNA-protamine complex which describes the site and mode of protamine binding to DNA and postulates, for the first time, specific inter- and intraprotamine interactions essential for the organization of this highly specialized chromatin . In this model, the central polyarginine segment of protamine binds in the minor groove of DNA, crosslinking and neutralizing the phosphodiester backbone of DNA while the COOH- and NH 2 -terminal ends of protamine participate in the formation of inter- and intraprotamine hydrogen, hydrophobic, and disulfide bonds . Each protamine segment is of sufficient length to fill one turn of DNA, and adjacent protamines are locked in place around DNA by multiple disulfide bridges . Such an arrangement generates a neutral, insoluble chromatin complex, uses all protamine sulfhydryl groups for cross linking, conserves volume, and effectively renders the chromatin invulnerable to most external influences .},

LDHC was detected initially in human spermatozoa and spermatogenic cells of the testes by gel electrophoresis. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize LDHC first in early pachytene primary spermatocytes with an apparent increase in quantity following meiosis to its final localization in and on the principle piece of the sperm tail. After several decades of biological, biochemical and genetic investigations we now know that the lactate dehydrogenase isozymes are ubiquitous in vertebrates, developmentally regulated, tissue and cell specific and multi-functional. Here we will review the history of LDHC and the work that demonstrates clearly that it is required for sperm to accomplish their ultimate goal, fertilization.},

Here, we demonstrate in vivo that ZCWPW1 is a H3K4me3 reader and show that its binding at chromatin promotes completion of DSB repair and synapsis in mouse testes. Based on multiple ChIP-seq and immunofluorescence analyses with mutants-including an H3K4me3-reader-dead variant of ZCWPW1 mice line-we establish that ZCWPW19s occupancy on chromatin is strongly but not exclusively promoted by the histone-modification activity of the PRDM9. ZCWPW1 localizes to DMC1-labelled DSB hotspots in a largely PRDM9-dependent manner, where it facilitates completion of synapsis by mediating the DSB repair process. In sum, our study demonstrates the function of a reader protein that carries out work resulting from an epigenetics-based recombination hotspot selection system in mammals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Design Prospective register based study.
Setting Medical Birth Register of Norway, the Norwegian Patient Register, and the induced abortion register.
Participants All Norwegian women that were pregnant between 2009-13.
Main outcome measure Risk of miscarriage according to the woman’s age and pregnancy history estimated by logistic regression.
Results There were 421 201 pregnancies during the study period. The risk of miscarriage was lowest in women aged 25-29 (10\%), and rose rapidly after age 30, reaching 53\% in women aged 45 and over. There was a strong recurrence risk of miscarriage, with age adjusted odds ratios of 1.54 (95\% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.60) after one miscarriage, 2.21 (2.03 to 2.41) after two, and 3.97 (3.29 to 4.78) after three consecutive miscarriages. The risk of miscarriage was modestly increased if the previous birth ended in a preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95\% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.29), stillbirth (1.30, 1.11 to 1.53), caesarean section (1.16, 1.12 to 1.21), or if the woman had gestational diabetes in the previous pregnancy (1.19, 1.05 to 1.36). The risk of miscarriage was slightly higher in women who themselves had been small for gestational age (1.08, 1.04 to 1.13).
Conclusions The risk of miscarriage varies greatly with maternal age, shows a strong pattern of recurrence, and is also increased after some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Miscarriage and other pregnancy complications might share underlying causes, which could be biological conditions or unmeasured common risk factors.},

  abstract = {Objective
 To estimate the association between maternal age and fetal death (spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth), taking into account a woman's reproductive history.

Design
 Prospective register linkage study.

Subjects
 All women with a reproductive outcome (live birth, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion leading to admission to hospital, induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or hydatidiform mole) in Denmark from 1978 to 1992; a total of 634\,272 women and 1\,221\,546 pregnancy outcomes.

Main outcome measures
 Age related risk of fetal loss, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth, and age related risk of spontaneous abortion stratified according to parity and previous spontaneous abortions.

Results
 Overall, 13.5\% of the pregnancies intended to be carried to term ended with fetal loss. At age 42 years, more than half of such pregnancies resulted in fetal loss. The risk of a spontaneous abortion was 8.9\% in women aged 20-24 years and 74.7\% in those aged 45 years or more. High maternal age was a significant risk factor for spontaneous abortion irrespective of the number of previous miscarriages, parity, or calendar period. The risk of an ectopic pregnancy and stillbirth also increased with increasing maternal age.

Conclusions
 Fetal loss is high in women in their late 30s or older, irrespective of reproductive history. This should be taken into consideration in pregnancy planning and counselling.},

By preventing high-risk pregnancies, especially in women of high parities, and those that would have ended in unsafe abortion, increased contraceptive use has reduced the maternal mortality ratio—the risk of maternal death per 100\hphantom{,}000 livebirths—by about 26\% in little more than a decade. A further 30\% of maternal deaths could be avoided by fulfilment of unmet need for contraception. The benefits of modern contraceptives to women's health, including non-contraceptive benefits of specific methods, outweigh the risks. Contraception can also improve perinatal outcomes and child survival, mainly by lengthening interpregnancy intervals. In developing countries, the risk of prematurity and low birthweight doubles when conception occurs within 6 months of a previous birth, and children born within 2 years of an elder sibling are 60\% more likely to die in infancy than are those born more than 2 years after their sibling.},

Studies of the means by which this energy is generated span a period of six decades. This review gives an overview of these studies, which demonstrate that both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, for which oxygen is friend, and glycolysis, for which sugar is friend, can provide the energy, independent of one another. In mouse sperm, glycolysis appears to be the dominant pathway; in bull sperm, oxidative phosphorylation is the predominant pathway. In the case of bull sperm, the high activity of the glycolytic pathway would maintain the intracellular pH too low to allow sperm capacitation; here sugar is enemy. The cow's oviduct has very low glucose concentration, thus allowing capacitation to go forward. The choice of the pathway of energy generation in vivo is set by the conditions in the oviduct of the conspecific female. The phospholipids of the sperm plasma membrane have a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids represented in their acyl moieties, rendering them highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; in this case oxygen is enemy. But the susceptibility of the sperm membrane to lethal damage by lipid peroxidation allows the female oviduct to dispose of sperm that have overstayed their welcome, and so keep in balance sperm access to the egg and sperm removal once this has occurred.},

  abstract = {Spermatozoa are highly specialized cells. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides the energy for supporting the key functions of the spermatozoa, is formed by 2 metabolic pathways, namely glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). It is produced in the mitochondria through OXPHOS as well as in the head and principal piece of the flagellum through glycolysis. However, there is a great discrepancy as to which method of ATP production is primarily utilized by the spermatozoa for successful fertilization. Mitochondrial respiration is considered to be a more efficient metabolic process for ATP synthesis in comparison to glycolysis. However, studies have shown that the diffusion potential of ATP from the mitochondria to the distal end of the flagellum is not sufficient to support sperm motility, suggesting that glycolysis in the tail region is the preferred pathway for energy production. It is suggested by many investigators that although glycolysis forms the major source of ATP along the flagellum, energy required for sperm motility is mainly produced during mitochondrial respiration. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that when glycolysis is inhibited, proper functioning and motility of spermatozoa remains intact although it is unclear whether such motility can be sustained for prolonged periods of time, or is sufficiently vigorous to achieve optimal fertilization. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of mammalian sperm energy metabolism and identify the preferred metabolic pathway for ATP generation which forms the basis of energy production in human spermatozoa during fertilization.},

        Results~Male infertility of unknown origin is a condition in which fertility impairment occurs spontaneously or due to an obscure or unknown cause. It includes two categories, unexplained male infertility and idiopathic male infertility. The dividing line between them is semen analysis, which is normal in the unexplained category and abnormal in idiopathic infertility. After ruling out female infertility factors, erectile problems and coital factors, modern andrology may help to analyze the unexplained male fertility problem on the basis of cellular and subcellular mechanisms. Furthermore, this analysis may lead to the selection of proper treatment options fitting the needs of patients with unexplained infertility.
        Conclusion~Despite the advances and innovation of sophisticated laboratory tests in the field of andrology, further research is still needed to solve the dilemma of infertility.},

While these genes have been pursued as targets for anticancer vaccines, whether these reactivated testis proteins have roles in supporting tumorigenic features is less studied.

  abstract = {PROBLEM: Sperm interaction with the immune system of the human cervix is poorly understood. METHOD: The leukocytic response of the human cervix to sperm was examined in a closely monitored patient population (N = 10), using monoclonal antibody cell identification techniques. Baseline data were collected from both cervical mucus and smears sampled before treatment by donor insemination. Donor insemination was timed to coincide with ovulation by monitoring plasma LH concentrations twice daily. Following insemination the numbers of leukocytes were recorded in cervical mucus and smear samples taken over a 24-h period relative to the time of treatment. Controls treated with “pure sperm,” seminal plasma, cryopreservative, and cervical smearing alone were also included in the study. RESULTS: Only those women treated with sperm cells exhibited substantial elevations in leukocyte numbers following inseminations. Additionally, serial cervical smearing induced an inflammatory response of the cervix. In all the women, the neutrophil was the predominant leukocyte of the cervix both during the baseline and treatment periods (median values ranged from 77 to 86\%). Macrophages, T-helper lymphocytes, and T-suppressor lymphocytes were also detected, but only in low numbers (2–10.6\%). Two patients and one control (“pure sperm”) became pregnant during their study cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the leukocytic reaction is a physiological response of the cervix to sperm, the function of which remains to be established.},

  abstract = {The function of sperm is to safely transport the haploid paternal genome to the egg containing the maternal genome. The subsequent fertilization leads to transmission of a new unique diploid genome to the next generation. Before the sperm can set out on its adventurous journey, remarkable arrangements need to be made during the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Haploid spermatids undergo extensive morphological changes, including a striking reorganization and compaction of their chromatin. Thereby, the nucleosomal, histone-based structure is nearly completely substituted by a protamine-based structure. This replacement is likely facilitated by incorporation of histone variants, post-translational histone modifications, chromatin-remodeling complexes, as well as transient DNA strand breaks. The consequences of mutations have revealed that a protamine-based chromatin is essential for fertility in mice but not in Drosophila. Nevertheless, loss of protamines in Drosophila increases the sensitivity to X-rays and thus supports the hypothesis that protamines are necessary to protect the paternal genome. Pharmaceutical approaches have provided the first mechanistic insights and have shown that hyperacetylation of histones just before their displacement is vital for progress in chromatin reorganization but is clearly not the sole inducer. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge on post-meiotic chromatin reorganization and reveal for the first time intriguing parallels in this process in Drosophila and mammals. We conclude with a model that illustrates the possible mechanisms that lead from a histone-based chromatin to a mainly protamine-based structure during spermatid differentiation.

This was revealed by co-hybridizing, in situ, fluorochrome-conjugated oligonucleotide probes specific for each isoform. To address the mechanism of isoform-specific mRNA localization, molecular chimeras were constructed by insertion of actin sequences between the Lac Z coding region and SV-40 3'UTR in a reporter plasmid. These constructs were transiently expressed in a mixed culture of embryonic fibroblasts, myoblasts and myotubes, beta-galactosidase activity within transfectants was revealed by a brief incubation with its substrate (X-gal). Since the blue-insoluble reaction product co-localized with the specific mRNAs expressed from each construct, it was used as a bioassay for mRNA localization. Transfectants were scored as either perinuclear, peripheral or nonlocalized with respect to the distribution of the blue product. The percentage of transfectants within those categories was quantitated as a function of the various constructs. This analysis revealed that for each actin mRNA its 3'UTR is necessary and sufficient to direct reporter transcripts to its appropriate compartment; beta-actin peripheral and alpha-actin perinuclear. In contrast, sequences from the 5'UTR through the coding region of either actin gene did not localize the blue product. Therefore, 3'UTR sequences play a key role in modulating the distribution of actin mRNAs in muscle cells. We propose that the mechanism of mRNA localization facilitates actin isoform sorting in the cytoplasm.},

This method provides very accurate and reproducible quantitation of gene copies. Unlike other quantitative PCR methods, real-time PCR does not require post-PCR sample handling, preventing potential PCR product carry-over contamination and resulting in much faster and higher throughput assays. The real-time PCR method has a very large dynamic range of starting target molecule determination (at least five orders of magnitude). Real-time quantitative PCR is extremely accurate and less labor-intensive than current quantitative PCR methods.},

During the mid-1990s the PCR was becoming a mature technology, impacting such areas such as cloning and automated sequencing. Many scientists were making efforts to tame the quantitative power of PCR. The power of exponential amplification was tremendous, but it had proven hard to control in quantitative applications. Many attempts were made to use so-called end-point quantification. This approach attempted to determine a starting target concentration based on the quantification of the final amplified product. Several aspects of PCR complicated the success of these efforts. A major source of difficulty was that PCR often reaches a plateau stage at which exponential amplification ceases and there is very little to no further product accumulation. Therefore, the product concentration at plateau is similar for all starting target amounts. In essence, it is impossible to accurately quantify starting target concentrations if PCR reaches plateau. Another complication is that PCR, like any enzyme-driven reaction, is sensitive to reaction inhibition. Many of the most interesting biological samples and methods for nucleic acid purification possessed known inhibitors of PCR (e.g., heme from blood). Southern and Northern blots with radioactive probes were the method of choice for many aspiring scientists wishing to have semiquantitative nucleic acid data, although these methods came with their …},

The fewer cycles necessary to produce a detectable fluorescence, the greater the number of target sequences. Results obtained with this approach indicate that a kinetic approach to PCR analysis can quantitate DNA sensitively, selectively and over a large dynamic range.

Content: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement.
Summary: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

Immunohistochemical studies show that in the testis PGAM-B is localized exclusively in germ cells. PGAM-B is detected in pachytene spermatocytes and in spermatids, but not in earlier stages of spermatogenesis. The muscle-specific PGAM isozyme was also found in testes of bull, cat, and rat, as well as in human sperm.

The binding of the 48/52-kDa proteins to RNA is reduced by heparin. The expression of the 48/52-kDa mouse proteins is germ cell-specific and developmentally regulated in the testis with a maximal amount of the two proteins being detected in early postmeiotic cells (round spermatids), a cell type where many mRNAs are stored. The 48/52-kDa proteins are detected solely in the nonpolysomal fractions of postmitochondrial adult testis extracts and are not detected in extracts of brain, liver, or prepuberal testes from 12-day-old mice.

A proportionally higher concentration of cytoplasmic immunolabeling was found within the lacunae of the anastomotic granulofilamentous network of the chromatoid body.

Spermatogenesis is disrupted in postmeiotic null germ cells with many misshapen and multinucleated spermatids, and no spermatozoa are detected in the epididymis. Apoptosis is increased in the testes of homozygotes, and real-time RT-PCR assays reveal large reductions in the mRNA levels of postmeiotic male germ cell mRNAs and smaller reductions of meiotic germ cell transcripts. In females, there is no apparent decrease in either the number of follicles or their morphology in ovaries obtained from 2- and 8-day-old Msy2 –/– mice. In contrast, follicle number and progression are reduced in 21-day-old Msy2 –/– ovaries. In adult Msy2 –/– females, oocyte loss increases, anovulation is observed, and multiple oocyte and follicle defects are seen.

In developing male germ cells, newly synthesized protamine mRNAs are stored for up to 7 days before translational activation. Translational repression of protamine 1 (Prm1) mRNA requires sequences present in its 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and substantial evidence suggests a role for the murine Y-box protein MSY4 in this process. To determine if MSY4 can mediate translational repression in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which the temporal window of MSY4 expression was extended during spermatogenesis. Expression of MSY4 disrupted the normal completion of spermatogenesis and caused dominant sterility. Immunocytochemical analysis of several markers, including the protamines, indicated that MSY4 prevented normal activation of translation. mRNAs whose translation was inhibited contained at least one MSY4 RNA recognition site, suggesting sequence-dependent translational repression. Altered translational activation resulted in defective processing of protamine 2 and severe defects in sperm morphogenesis. These results suggest that MSY4 plays an active role in translational repression of several mRNAs in differentiating spermatids.},

In this study we used the yeast three-hybrid system to clone Msy4, which encodes a novel member of the Y box family of nucleic acid binding proteins. MSY4 specifically binds to a site within the 5′ most 37 nucleotides in the Prm1 3′ UTR. Msy4 is highly expressed in the testis, and the protein is detected in the cytoplasm of germ cells in both the testis and the ovary, where repressed messages are stored. Analysis of a previously described 48/50-kDa binding activity in testis extracts by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoprecipitation indicates the activity is composed of MSY4 and MSY2, another mouse Y box protein. Polysome analysis demonstrates MSY4 is associated with mRNPs, consistent with MSY4 having a role in storing repressed messages.},

  abstract = {Abstract The poly(A) binding protein (PABP), a conserved protein that binds to the 3? poly(A) tail on mRNAs in eukaryotic cells, has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. Two PABP cDNAs with different sequences were isolated from mouse testis cDNA libraries. The predicted amino acid sequence of one, PABP1, is nearly identical (98.9\%) to human liver PABP, while 80\% of the amino acids of the second, PABPt, are identical to mouse and human PABPs. Northern blots reveal that there is one major PABP mRNA species in liver, muscle, kidney, and brain, two in spleen, and at least four in testis. The levels of PABP mRNA in testis are 5?10-fold higher than in these somatic tissues, but surprisingly the vast majority of all PABP mRNA size variants sediment more slowly than single ribosome, indicating strong translational repression. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays demonstrate that PABPt mRNAs are abundant only in testis. Northern blots of RNAs purified from highly enriched spermatogenic cells show that the high levels, multiple sizes of PABP mRNAs, and the PABPt mRNA are present in meiotic and early haploid spermatogenic cells, and are sharply reduced in late haploid cells. Comparison of the binding of PABP1 and PABPt to poly(A) Sepharose in vitro revealed subtle differences, even though PABPt contains substitutions for highly conserved aromatic amino acids that are thought to be necessary for binding to poly(A). The existence of two PABP isoforms in mouse spermatogenic cells could influence cytoplasmic gene expression during spermatogenesis. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins that bind to the 3′ untranslated region of mRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression. Here we examine the association between the 70 kDa poly (A) binding protein (PABP) and stored (RNP) and polysomal mRNAs during mammalian male germ cell development. PABP mRNA levels increase as germ cells enter meiosis, reaching a maximum in the early postmeiotic stages, and decreasing to a nearly nondetectable level towards the end of spermatogenesis. Most of the PABP mRNA is found in the nonpolysomal fractions of postmitochondrial extracts, suggesting that PABP mRNA is either inefficiently translated or stored as RNPs during spermatogenesis. Virtually all of the testicular PABP is bound to either polysomal or nonpolysomal mRNAs, with little, if any, free PABP detectable. Analysis of several specific mRNAs reveals PABP is bound to both stored (RNP) and translated forms of the mRNAs. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry indicate PABP is widespread in the mammalian testis, with maximal amounts detected in postmeiotic round spermatids. The presence of PABP in elongating spermatids, a cell type in which PABP mRNA is nearly absent, suggests that PABP is a stable protein in the later stages of male germ cell development. The high level of testicular PABP in round spermatids and in mRNPs suggests a role for PABP in the storage as well as in the subsequent translation of developmentally regulated mRNAs in the mammalian testis. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {. The gene encoding the testis-specific isoform of mouse poly(A) binding protein (Pabp2) has been isolated and sequenced. Unexpectedly, comparison of the sequence of genomic and cDNAs demonstrated that the Pabp2 gene lacks introns, whereas all other functional Pabp genes in plants, amphibians, and mammals contain introns. Thus, the mouse Pabp2 gene is a retroposon, created by synthesizing a reverse transcriptase copy of a processed mRNA and inserting the copy into the genome. The Pabp2 retroposon is unusual because it is functional: previous work demonstrates that its promoter drives the accumulation of Pabp2 mRNA in meiotic and early haploid spermatogenic cells, and the Pabp2 mRNA encodes a protein whose size and RNA-binding specificities are characteristic of PABP in plants, yeast, and mammals (Kleene et al. 1994). Two novel factors can be implicated in the retention of function of the Pabp2 retroposon. First, the promoter of the Pabp2 gene is not derived from its intron-containing progenitor, Pabp1. Second, mRNAs encoding somatic PABP isoform, PABP1, are present at high levels in meiotic and haploid spermatogenic cells. Both features contrast with the phosphoglycerate kinase 2 retroposon, which is believed to compensate for the depletion of the somatic isoform due to X-chromosome inactivation in meiotic spermatogenic cells. We also document that more functional retroposons are expressed in meiotic and haploid spermatogenic cells than in any other tissue and speculate that transcriptional derepression in spermatogenic cells favors the creation of expressed retroposons.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis is briefly defined as the production of mature spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells at the end of a strictly regulated process. It is well known that, to a large
extent, transcriptional activity ceases at mid-spermiogenesis. Several mRNAs transcribed during early stages of spermatogenesis are stored as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). During the later
stages, translational control of these mRNAs is mainly carried out in a time dependent-manner by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) in cooperation with other RNA-binding proteins and
translation-related factors. Conserved PABPs specifically bind to poly(A) tails at the 3′ ends of mRNAs to regulate their translational activity in spermatogenic cells. Studies in this field
have revealed that PABPs, particularly poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1), Pabpc2, and the embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (Epab), play roles in the translational regulation of
mRNAs required at later stages of spermatogenesis. In this review article, we evaluated the spatial and temporal expression patterns and potential functions of these PABPs in spermatogenic
cells during spermatogenesis. The probable relationship between alterations in PABP expression and the development of male infertility is also reviewed.},

  abstract = {The study of spermatogenesis requires accurate identification of the stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. A stage refers to the unique association of germ cell types at a particular phase of development, as seen in a cross-sectioned seminiferous tubule. Stage-identification, however, is a daunting task. There are 12 stages represented in the mouse seminiferous epithelium. Stages are typically identified on the basis of the morphology of the developing acrosome of spermatids. Although the characteristic features of the acrosome are well-documented in ultrastructure images, a reagent that can highlight the subtle differences in acrosome shape under the light microscope is lacking. Here we demonstrate that a polyclonal antibody raised against the mouse acrosomal protein SP-10 is extremely useful for stage identification. Immunohistochemistry showed that the anti-SP-10 antibody is highly specific for the acrosome of spermatids, as no other cell type in the epithelium showed immunoreactivity. At lower magnification, the gross shape of the acrosome and the increasing intensity of immunostaining served as a guide for the identification of stages I–XII. At higher magnification, characteristic morphological features–such as whether the part of the acrosome that contacts the nuclear surface is round (stage III) or flat (stage IV) or curved (stage VI)–could be identified unambiguously. Overall, we present evidence that SP-10 is a useful marker for staging the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. The anti-SP-10 antibody works well in different fixatives, on paraffin-embedded as well as cryosections, and has been shown to be useful for characterizing spermatogenic defects in mutant mice. Mol.

SPACA1 is a membrane protein that localizes in the equatorial segment of spermatozoa in mammals and is reported to function in sperm-egg fusion. We produced a Spaca1 gene-disrupted mouse line and found that the male mice were infertile. The cause of this sterility was abnormal shaping of the sperm head reminiscent of globozoospermia in humans. Disruption of Spaca1 led to the disappearance of the nuclear plate, a dense lining of the nuclear envelope facing the inner acrosomal membrane. This coincided with the failure of acrosomal expansion during spermiogenesis and resulted in the degeneration and disappearance of the acrosome in mature spermatozoa. Thus, these findings clarify part of the cascade leading to globozoospermia.},

Co-incubation of zona-free mouse oocytes with capacitated mouse spermatozoa in the presence of varying concentrations of anti-recmSLLP1 serum or recmSLLP1 also inhibited sperm–oolemma binding. A complete inhibition of binding and fusion of spermatozoa to the oocyte occurred at 12.5 μM concentration of recmSLLP1, while conventional chicken and human lysozymes did not block sperm–egg binding. mSLLP1 showed receptor sites in the perivitelline space as well as on the microvillar region of the egg plasma membrane. The retention of mSLLP1 in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, the inhibitory effects of both recmSLLP1 and antibodies to SLLP1 on in vitro fertilization with both cumulus intact and zona-free eggs, and the definition of complementary SLLP1-binding sites on the egg plasma membrane together support the hypothesis that a c lysozyme-like protein is involved in the binding of spermatozoa to the egg plasma membrane during fertilization.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a tightly regulated process leading to the development of spermatozoa. To elucidate the molecular spermatogenic mechanisms, we identified an acrosome-specific gene AEP1 in spermatids, which is located in rat chromosome 17p14 with a transcript size of 3,091 bp encoding a signal peptide, zinc finger-like motif, coiled-coil region, several predicted glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed the restricted expression of AEP1 to the testis only. In postnatal rat testes, AEP1 mRNA became detectable from postnatal 25 dpp (round spermatids) and onwards. By using in situ hybridization (ISH) and flow cytometry-fluorescent ISH, only the haploid spermatids yielded the positive AEP1 signal. Immunohistochemistry showed that AEP1 was expressed in the acrosomal cap of late-staged germ cells in rat testis, and co-localized with the acrosomal marker, peanut agglutinin. The spatial expression of AEP1 immunoreactivity in testis was conserved among diverse mammalian species (rat, pig, monkey, human). To further study its roles in spermatogenesis, we showed AEP1 and β-actin was associated together in complex by co-immunoprecipitation in adult germ cells and by immunofluorescence assay in isolated spermatozoon. In human testes diagnosed with hypospermatogenesis, lower expression of AEP1 was observed, whereas there was no detectable signal in undescended testes. In short, AEP1 is an evolutionary-conserved acrosome-specific gene and likely functions in acrosome-cap formation. J. Cell. Physiol. 209: 755–766, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Spata31-deficient (Spata31flox/flox; Vasa-Cre) male mice exhibited low sperm count and premature shedding of germ cells into the lumen, ultimately causing azoospermia and male sterility. Mechanistically, the Spata31 deficiency resulted in reduced expression of the adhesion protein nectin-3 and cytoskeletal protein β-actin at the apical ectoplasmic specialization.

The SAMP14 sequence predicted a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein with a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus, and a putative transamidase cleavage site in the proprotein. Attachment of SAMP14 to the membrane by a lipid anchor was confirmed by its sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. SAMP14 has a single functional domain similar to the Ly-6 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor superfamily of proteins, and the gene mapped to 19q13.33, near the PLAUR locus for uPAR at 19q13.2. Northern and dot blotting showed that SAMP14 expression was testis-specific. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy with antisera to purified recombinant SAMP14 localized the protein to outer and inner acrosomal membranes as well as the acrosomal matrix of ejaculated human sperm. Acrosome-reacted sperm demonstrated SAMP14 immunofluorescence, indicating its retention on the inner acrosomal membrane following the acrosome reaction. However, SAMP14 localized to the entire sperm when unwashed swim-up sperm from the ejaculate were stained, indicating that some SAMP14 is loosely associated with the plasma membrane. Antibodies against recombinant SAMP14 inhibited both the binding and the fusion of human sperm to zona free hamster eggs, suggesting that SAMP14 may have a role in sperm-egg interaction. SAMP14 represents a GPI-anchored putative receptor in the Ly-6/uPAR family that is exposed on the inner acrosomal membrane after the acrosome reaction.},

Sources of RNA for the initial DDRT-PCR screen were purified mouse type A spermatogonia, adult mouse wild-type testis, and W/Wv mutant mouse testis. We identified cDNA fragments for mDEAH9, RanBP5, GC3, GC12, and GC14 in testis and type A spermatogonia samples from wild-type mice, but not in samples from the W/Wv mouse testis. These same transcripts were absent in Northern blots of testis RNA from mice treated with busulfan 30 days prior, but were present in testis RNA from wild-type mice at 5, 15, 25, and 40 days of age. The mDEAH9 gene was expressed in many tissues, whereas RanBP5 and GC12 genes were expressed predominantly in the testis with much lower expression in other tissues. The expression of GC3 and GC14 were limited to the testis as evidenced by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. The mDEAH9 transcript was not detected in cultured interstitial cells but was found at low levels in cultured immature Sertoli cells, whereas the RanBP5, GC3, GC12, and GC14 transcripts were not detected in either cultured testicular interstitial cells or cultured Sertoli cells. RT-PCR analyses of isolated spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids revealed that mDEAH9, RanBP5, GC3, GC12, and GC14 genes were expressed in all 3 cellular populations. In situ hybridization analyses of testis samples from 40-day-old mice localized expression of mDEAH9, RanBP5, GC3, GC12, and GC14 to the seminiferous tubules. RanBP5 expression appeared to be regulated during the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, with the highest expression in stages III through VII. Expression of GC14 was greatest in the meiotic germ cell populations.},

Spaca7 transcripts are detected only in testis and predict a 158-residue mature polypeptide with one potential N-glycosylation site and no cysteines. Orthologs are present in various species, including mice and humans. We developed a polyclonal antibody to mouse SPACA7 to study its expression and function. Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy detected SPACA7 only in testis, and it was detected in testis starting at Postnatal Day 21 and into adulthood. Immunofluorescence staining of testicular germ cells detected weak SPACA7 expression as early as zygotene spermatocytes. Higher expression was observed in round spermatids, where SPACA7 was localized to a perinuclear spot adjacent to the Golgi and to the acrosome of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that SPACA7 is localized within the proacrosomal granule of round spermatids and the acrosome of spermatozoa. Finally, we showed that SPACA7 was retained within the acrosome of epididymal sperm and was released upon the acrosome reaction. To assess if SPACA7 was involved in fertilization, in vitro fertilization assays in the presence of anti-SPACA7 IgG were performed. Anti-SPACA7 inhibited fertilization of cumulus-intact eggs and prominently delayed cumulus dispersal. However, anti-SPACA7 did not inhibit fertilization of cumulus-free eggs. Our findings indicate that release of SPACA7 from the acrosome accelerates cumulus dispersal and facilitates fertilization via unknown mechanisms. This study is the first to document the expression of endogenous SPACA7 and a function for this novel acrosomal protein., SPACA7, a novel male germ cell-specific acrosomal protein, is released upon the acrosome reaction and facilitates cumulus dispersal and fertilization.},

Although acrosome biogenesis is an important aspect of spermiogenesis, the molecular mechanism that regulates this event remains unknown. In the present study, we identified a novel gene, Fam170b (family with sequence similarity 170, member B), exclusively expressed in mouse testes. Fam170b expression first started at postnatal week 3, and increased in an age-dependent manner until plateauing in adulthood. Immunofluorescence staining revealed its enrichment in round spermatids, and redistribution to a perinuclear spot adjacent to the Golgi and the acrosome of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa; this localization was shared between mouse and human spermatozoa. Anti-FAM170B antibody was remarkably found to inhibit murine in vitro fertilization, specifically blocking the acrosome reaction. We further determined that FAM170B interacts with GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing protein) during acrosome formation, as verified by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, we document the expression and function for the endogenous acrosomal protein FAM170B during spermiogenesis and fertilization. Mol. Reprod.

Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that all five Tssk mRNAs are almost exclusively expressed postmeiotically in the testis. Recombinant mouse and human Tssks were cloned and used for validation of an array of commercial and custom-made antibodies against Tssks. Immunolocalization in mouse testis, and in mouse and human sperm, showed that Tssk1, Tssk2, Tssk4 and Tssk6, but not Tssk3, were present in mouse sperm and in germ cells from mouse testis. TSSK1, TSSK2 and TSSK6 were also detected in human sperm, while TSSK3 was absent. In both mouse and human sperm, Tssk1 was partially soluble, while Tssk2, Tssk4 and Tssk6 were insoluble in non-ionic detergents. In vitro recombinant TSSK2 activity assays showed maximum enzymatic activity at 5 mM Mg2+ and a Km for ATP of ∼10 µM. These, observations together with findings that the Tssk1/Tssk2 double knock-out as well as the Tssk6 null mice are sterile without presenting other detectable defects, suggest that these kinases could be used as targets for male contraception.},

Primakoff, 1984, J. Cell Biol., 99:1634-1641). We have isolated three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of the IgG1 subclass, PH-20, PH-21, and PH-22, that bind to the PH-20 antigen. The PH-20 MAb strongly inhibited (approximately 90\%) sperm binding to the guinea pig egg zona pellucida at saturating antibody concentrations (greater than 20 micrograms/ml). Half-maximal inhibition of sperm binding to the zona was obtained with approximately 2 micrograms/ml PH-20 MAb. The PH-21 MAb at saturating concentration (50 micrograms/ml) partially inhibited (approximately 45\%) sperm-zona binding, and the PH-22 MAb (50 micrograms/ml) did not inhibit (0\%) sperm-zona binding. Essentially the same amounts of the three MAbs were bound to sperm under the conditions where inhibition (PH-20, PH-21) or no inhibition (PH-22) of sperm-zona binding was observed, which indicates that the different levels of inhibition did not arise from different levels of MAb binding. Competition binding assays with 125I-labeled MAbs showed that PH-21 binding to sperm was not affected by the binding of PH-20 or PH-22. However, that PH-20 and PH-22 blocked each other's binding to sperm suggests that their recognized determinants may be relatively close to one another. The results indicate that the migrating PH-20 antigen has a required function in sperm binding to the zona pellucida and that the PH-20 MAb affects is active site.},

  abstract = {Sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida in mammals is a cell-cell adhesion process that is generally species specific. The guinea pig sperm protein PH-20 has a required function in sperm adhesion to the zona pellucida of guinea pig eggs. PH-20 is located on both the sperm plasma membrane and acrosomal membrane. We report here the isolation and sequence of a full-length cDNA for PH-20 (available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession number X56332). The derived amino acid sequence shows a mature protein of 468 amino acids containing six N-linked glycosylation sites and twelve cysteines, eight of which are tightly clustered near the COOH terminus. The sequence indicates PH-20 is a novel protein with no relationship to the mouse sperm adhesion protein galactosyl transferase and no significant homology with other known proteins. The two PH-20 populations, plasma membrane and acrosomal membrane, could arise because one form of PH-20 is encoded and differentially targeted at different spermatogenic stages. Alternatively, two different forms of PH-20 could be encoded. Our evidence thus far reveals only one sequence coding for PH-20: Southern blots of guinea pig genomic DNA indicated there is a single PH-20 gene, Northern blots showed a single size PH-20 message (approximately 2.2 kb), and no sequence variants were found among the sequenced cDNA clones. Cross-species Southern blots reveal the presence of a homologue of the PH-20 gene in mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, bovine, monkey, and human genomic DNA, showing the PH-20 gene is conserved among mammals. Since genes for zona glycoproteins are also conserved among mammals, the general features of sperm and zona proteins involved in mammalian sperm-egg adhesion may have been evolutionarily maintained. Species specificity may result from limited changes in these molecules, either in their binding domains or in other regions that affect the ability of the binding domains to interact.},

In this study, we have produced mice carrying a null mutation in the PH-20 gene using homologous recombination. Despite the absence of sperm PH-20, the mutant male mice were still fertile. In vitro fertilization assays showed that mouse sperm lacking PH-20 possess a reduced ability to disperse cumulus cells from the cumulus mass, resulting in delayed fertilization solely at the early stages after insemination. Moreover, SDS-PAGE of sperm extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis revealed the presence of other hyaluronidase(s), except PH-20, presumably within the acrosome of mouse sperm. These data provide evidence that PH-20 is not essential for fertilization, at least in the mouse, suggesting that the other hyaluronidase(s) may play an important role in sperm penetration through the cumulus cell layer and/or the egg zona pellucida, possibly in cooperation with PH-20, although the importance of sperm motility cannot be neglected.},

However, mouse sperm lacking PH-20 were still capable of penetrating the cumulus mass despite a delayed dispersal of cumulus cells. Intriguingly, a 55-kDa hyaluronan-hydrolyzing protein was abundantly present in wild-type and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm. In this study, we purified the 55-kDa mouse protein from soluble protein extracts released from epididymal sperm by acrosome reaction and identified as a hyaluronidase, Hyal5. Hyal5 was exclusively expressed in the testis and formed a 160-kbp gene cluster together with Hyalp1, Hyal4, and Ph-20 on mouse chromosome 6. Hyal5 was a single-chain hyaluronidase present on the plasma and acrosomal membranes of sperm presumably as a GPI-anchored protein. Moreover, hyaluronan zymography revealed that Hyal5 is enzymatically active in the pH range 5–7 and inactive at pH 3 and 4. Both Hyal5-enriched PH-20-free soluble protein extracts and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm were capable of dispersing cumulus cells from the cumulus mass. Cumulus cell dispersal was strongly inhibited by the presence of a hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. These results suggest that in the mouse, Hyal5 may function principally as a “cumulus matrix depolymerase” in the sperm penetration through the cumulus mass and in the local hyaluronan hydrolysis near or on the surface of the egg zona pellucida to enable the proximal region of sperm tail to move freely. PH-20 may compensate in part for the functional roles of Hyal5.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling acrosome biogenesis and acrosome exocytosis during fertilization are largely unknown. Equatorin (Eqtn) is a membrane protein that is specifically localized to the acrosomal membrane. In the present study, the physiological functions of Eqtn were investigated using a gene knockout mouse model. We found that Eqtn−/− males were subfertile. Only approximately 50\% of plugged females were pregnant after mating with Eqtn−/− males, whereas more than 90\% of plugged females were pregnant after mating with control males. Sperm and acrosomes from Eqtn−/− mice presented normal motility and morphology. However, the fertilization and induced acrosome exocytosis rates of Eqtn-deficient sperm were dramatically reduced. Further studies revealed that the Eqtn protein might interact with Syntaxin1a and SNAP25, but loss of Eqtn did not affect the protein levels of these genes. Therefore, our study demonstrates that Eqtn is not essential for acrosome biogenesis but is required for the acrosome reaction. Eqtn is involved in the fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane and the sperm plasma membrane during the acrosome reaction, most likely via an interaction with the SNARE complex.},

In an in silico search for germ cell-specific genes, Zpbp1 and its novel paralog, Zpbp2, were discovered and confirmed to be expressed only in the testes in both mice and humans. To study the in vivo functions of both ZPBP proteins, we disrupted Zpbp1 and Zpbp2 in mice. Males lacking ZPBP1 were sterile, with abnormal round-headed sperm morphology and no forward sperm motility. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that absence of ZPBP1 prevents proper acrosome compaction, resulting in acrosome fragmentation and disruption of the Sertoli-spermatid junctions. Males null for ZPBP2 were subfertile, demonstrated aberrant acrosomal membrane invaginations, and produced dysmorphic sperm with reduced ability to penetrate zona pellucida. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of ZPBPs from amphibians, birds, and mammals suggests that these paralogous genes coevolved to play cooperative roles during spermiogenesis. Whereas ZPBP1 was discovered for an in vitro role in sperm-egg interactions, we have shown that both ZPBP proteins play an earlier structural role during spermiogenesis.},

We report here that a Mr 56,000 protein found on mouse sperm has properties expected for a sperm component that recognizes and binds to ZP3. This sperm protein is radiolabeled preferentially by a photoactivatable heterobifunctional crosslinker ("Denny-Jaffee reagent") covalently linked to purified ZP3, binds very tightly to ZP3-affinity columns, and is localized to heads of acrosome-intact but not acrosome-reacted sperm.

  abstract = {Background
The sperm protein IZUMO1 (Izumo sperm-egg fusion 1) and its recently identified binding partner on the oolemma, IZUMO1R, are among the first ligand-receptor pairs shown to be essential for gamete recognition and adhesion. However, the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not appear to be directly responsible for promoting the fusion of the gamete membranes, suggesting that this critical phase of the fertilization cascade requires the concerted action of alternative fusogenic machinery. It has therefore been proposed that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in the organization and/or stabilization of higher-order heteromeric complexes in spermatozoa that are required for membrane fusion.

Results
Here, we show that fertilization-competent (acrosome reacted) mouse spermatozoa harbor several high molecular weight protein complexes, a subset of which are readily able to adhere to solubilized oolemmal proteins. At least two of these complexes contain IZUMO1 in partnership with GLI pathogenesis-related 1 like 1 (GLIPR1L1). This interaction is associated with lipid rafts and is dynamically remodeled upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis in preparation for sperm adhesion to the oolemma. Accordingly, the selective ablation of GLIPR1L1 leads to compromised sperm function characterized by a reduced ability to undergo the acrosome reaction and a failure of IZUMO1 redistribution.

Conclusions
Collectively, this study characterizes multimeric protein complexes on the sperm surface and identifies GLIPRL1L1 as a physiologically relevant regulator of IZUMO1 function and the fertilization process.},

We cloned and sequenced cDNAs for previously unidentified mouse Adams that belong to the second group. We found that all the Adam genes in the second phylogenic group are transcribed by both somatic and germ cells in mouse testis, representing a unique expression pattern different from that of the first-group Adams. Genomic analyses revealed that all the second-group Adam genes lack introns interrupting protein-coding sequences and many of them are present as multicopy genes, resulting in total of 14 functional mouse genes in this phylogenic group. Comparing the mouse and human ADAM genes, we found that a number of these mouse Adam genes do not have human orthologues and, even if they exist, some orthologues are pseudogenes in human. These results suggest the differential expansion of the second-group Adam genes in the mouse genome during evolution and a relationship between these Adams and male reproduction unique to mouse.},

Trends Genet 16: 83–87; Edwards et al., 2008. Mol Aspects Med 29: 258–289). We previously reported that testase 1 (ADAM 24) is the first identified metalloprotease present on the surface of mature sperm. To investigate a potential role of testase 1 in fertilization, we generated testase 1 deficient mice. Testase 1 null male mice showed reduced fertility, producing only half the number of offspring when compared to wild-type littermates. In a standard in vitro fertilization assay, we found that sperm lacking testase 1 gave rise to polyspermic fertilization, a phenotypic feature that might contribute to failure of normal embryo development due to polyaneuploidy. Furthermore, in vivo, we found that testase 1 null males produced a higher number of polyspermic embryos at the pronuclear stage. These findings suggest that testase 1 is a sperm plasma membrane component which contributes to the prevention of polyspermy at the level of the oocyte plasma membrane. Mol. Reprod.

CatSper is located specifically in the principal piece of the sperm tail. Targeted disruption of the gene results in male sterility in otherwise normal mice. Sperm motility is decreased markedly in CatSper-/- mice, and CatSper-/- sperm are unable to fertilize intact eggs. In addition, the cyclic-AMP-induced Ca2+ influx is abolished in the sperm of mutant mice. CatSper is thus~vital to cAMP-mediated Ca2+ influx in sperm, sperm motility and fertilization. CatSper represents an excellent target for non-hormonal contraceptives for both men and women.},

Hyperactivation requires CatSper1 and CatSper2 putative ion channel genes, but the function of two other related genes (CatSper3 and CatSper4) is not known. Here we show that targeted disruption of murine CatSper3 or CatSper4 also abrogated ICatSper, sperm cell hyperactivated motility and male fertility but did not affect spermatogenesis or initial motility. Direct protein interactions among CatSpers, the sperm specificity of these proteins, and loss of ICatSper in each of the four CatSper−/− mice indicate that CatSpers are highly specialized flagellar proteins.},

Our in silico and in vitro analyses revealed that the expressions of these genes are testis- and germ cell-specific, and that they are regulated in a stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis. We generated antibodies against the proteins encoded by seven of the genes to facilitate their characterization in male germ cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that one of these proteins was expressed only in testicular germ cells, three were expressed in both testicular germ cells and testicular sperm, and the remaining three were expressed in sperm of the testicular stages and in mature sperm from the epididymis. Further analysis of the latter three proteins showed that they were all associated with cytoskeletal structures in the sperm flagellum. Among them, MORN5, which is predicted to contain three MORN motifs, is conserved between mouse and human sperm. In conclusion, we herein identify 13 authentic genes with male germ cell-specific expression, and provide comprehensive information about these genes and their encoded products. Our finding will facilitate future investigations into the functional roles of these novel genes in spermatogenesis and sperm functions.},

In order to elucidate the function of CD46, we produced mice carrying a null mutation in the CD46 gene by using homologous recombination. Despite the absence of CD46, the mice were healthy and both sexes were fertile. However, to our surprise, the fertilizing ability of males appeared to be facilitated by disruption of the CD46 gene, as the average number of pups born from CD46−/− males was significantly greater than that of wild-type males. It was also revealed that the incidence of the spontaneous acrosome reaction doubled in CD46−/− sperm compared to that in wild-type sperm. It was assumed that this increase caused the heightened fertilizing ability found in CD46−/− sperm. These data suggest that CD46 may have some role in regulating sperm acrosome reaction.},

CD55 \& CD59, two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, have been detected previously in some studies also in the acrosomal region of chemically fixed spermatozoa but never demonstrated at this site on unfixed spermatozoa. Dual labelling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy on fresh unfixed spermatozoa, with minimal subsequent time to fixation, has shown CD55 to be markedly expressed on the IAM, more than on the plasma membrane. However, unlike for CD46, CD55 displayed patchy staining over the acrosome, with some variation between individual spermatozoa. All IAM-associated CD55 was localised within GM1-containing lipid rafts. CD59 was expressed also on the IAM, but in a pronounced granular pattern with more variation observed from one spermatozoa to another. Both CD55 \& CD59 were released from the IAM by PI-PLC, demonstrating them to be GPI-anchored. Analysis of acrosome-reacted spermatozoal CD55 by Western blotting revealed a novel single 55?kDa protein lacking significant oligosaccharides susceptible to glycosidases. Antibody-induced membrane rafting and release of CD55 \& CD59 in vitro may have influenced previous results. Significant coexpression of CD55 \& CD46 on the IAM suggests some functional cooperation at this site.},

The aim of the present study was to determine whether Apodemus sperm may be protected against complement-mediated damage by expression of CD55 and CD59 in the absence of CD46. We demonstrate here that, like Mus musculus mice (house mice), wild-caught Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus microps and Apodemus sylvaticus mice express both glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)- and transmembrane (TM)-anchored testicular CD55 mRNA transcripts. In Mus, testicular GPI- and TM-CD55 transcripts are generated by two distinct but closely related genes. We show that in contrast to Mus, CD55 isoforms in A. sylvaticus are generated by alternative splicing of a single copy gene. Testicular CD59 mRNA transcripts were also identified in A. flavicollis, A. microps, A. sylvaticus and M. musculus. CD55 and CD59 proteins are broadly distributed on epididymal sperm from wild-caught Apodemus and Mus mice as well as BALB/c mice, with expression on the acrosome, neck and tail. Thus, despite not expressing CD46 protein, Apodemus sperm may be protected against complement-mediated injury in the female genital tract by CD55 and CD59.},

  abstract = {FRG1 is considered a candidate gene for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) based on its location at chromosome 4qter and its upregulation in FSHD muscle. The FRG1 protein (FRG1P) localizes to nucleoli, Cajal bodies (and speckles), and has been suggested to be a component of the human spliceosome but its exact function is unknown. Recently, transgenic mice overexpressing high levels of FRG1P in skeletal muscle were described to present with muscular dystrophy. Moreover, upregulation of FRG1P was demonstrated to correlate with missplicing of specific pre-mRNAs. In this study, we have combined colocalization studies with yeast two-hybrid screens to identify proteins that associate with FRG1P. We demonstrate that artificially induced nucleolar aggregates of VSV-FRG1P specifically sequester proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. In addition, we have identified SMN, PABPN1, and FAM71B, a novel speckle and Cajal body protein, as binding partners of FRG1P. All these proteins are, or seem to be, involved in RNA biogenesis. Our data confirm the presence of FRG1P in protein complexes containing human spliceosomes and support a potential role of FRG1P in either splicing or another step in nuclear RNA biogenesis. Intriguingly, among FRG1P-associated proteins are SMN and PABPN1, both being involved in neuromuscular disorders, possibly through RNA biogenesis-related processes.},

Expression of Cd9 enhances membrane fusion between muscle cells9 and promotes viral infection in some cells10,11. Fertilization also involves membrane fusion, between gametes. In mammals, the sperm binds to microvilli on the egg surface, and sperm-egg membrane fusion first occurs around the equatorial region of the sperm head12. The fused membrane is then disrupted, and the sperm nucleus as well as the cytoplasm is incorporated into the egg. Cd9 is expressed on the plasma membrane of the mouse egg, and an anti-Cd9 monoclonal antibody inhibits sperm-egg surface interactions13. We generated Cd9−/− mice and found that homozygous mutant females were infertile. Sperm-egg binding was normal, but sperm-egg fusion was almost entirely inhibited in eggs from Cd9−/− females. Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, which signal fertilization, were absent in almost all mutant eggs; in rare cases, a response occurred after a long time period. In normal animals, Cd9 molecules were expressed on the egg microvilli and became densely concentrated at the sperm attachment site. Thus, our results show that Cd9 is important in the gamete fusion process at fertilization.},

We generated and analyzed mice deficient for CD37. Despite the high expression of CD37 on cells of the immune system, no changes in development and cellular composition of lymphoid organs were observed in mice lacking CD37. Analyses of humoral immune responses revealed a reduced level of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) in the sera of nonimmunized mice and an alteration of responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. Antibody responses to model antigen administered in the absence of adjuvant and to viral infections were generally poor in CD37-deficient mice. These poor antibody responses could be overcome by the immunization of antigen together with adjuvant. These results suggest a role for CD37 in T-cell–B-cell interactions which manifests itself under suboptimal costimulatory conditions.},

We describe H1T2, an histone H1 variant selectively and transiently expressed in male haploid germ cells during spermiogenesis. In round and elongating spermatids, H1T2 specifically localizes to a chromatin domain at the apical pole, revealing a polarity in the spermatid nucleus. Inactivation by homologous recombination shows that H1T2 is critical for spermiogenesis as male H1t2–/– mice have greatly reduced fertility. Analysis of spermiogenesis in H1t2 mutant mice shows delayed nuclear condensation and aberrant elongation. As a result, mutant spermatids are characterized by the presence of residual cytoplasm, acrosome detachment, and fragmented DNA. Hence, H1T2 is a protein required for proper cell restructuring and DNA condensation during the elongation phase of spermiogenesis.},

The HANP1/H1T2 protein was specifically localized to the nuclei of murine spermatids during differentiation steps 5 to 13 but not to the nuclei of mature sperm. HANP1/H1T2 contains an arginine-serine-rich domain and an ATP/GTP binding site, and it binds to DNA, ATP, and protamine. To investigate the physiological role of HANP1/H1T2, we generated Hanp1/H1T2-disrupted mutant mice. Homozygous Hanp1/H1T2 mutant males were infertile, but females were fertile. Although a substantial number of sperm were recovered from the epididymides, their shape and function were abnormal. During sperm morphogenesis, the formation of nuclei was disturbed and protamine-1 and -2 were only weakly detectable in the nuclei. The chromatin packaging was aberrant, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. The mutant sperm exhibited deficient motility and were not competent to fertilize eggs under in vitro fertilization conditions; however, they were capable of fertilizing eggs via intracytoplasmic sperm injection that resulted in the birth of healthy progeny. Thus, we found that HANP1/H1T2 is essential for nuclear formation in functional spermatozoa and is specifically involved in the replacement of histones with protamines during spermiogenesis.

  abstract = {Chromatin remodeling is a major event that occurs during mammalian
 spermiogenesis, the process of spermatid maturation into spermatozoa. Nuclear
 condensation during spermiogenesis is accomplished by replacing somatic
 histones (linker histone H1 and core histones) and the testis-specific linker
 histone, H1t, with transition proteins and protamines. It has long been
 thought that H1t is the only testis-specific linker histone, and that all
 linker histones are replaced by transition proteins, and subsequently by
 protamines during spermiogenesis. Here, we report the identification and
 characterization of a spermatid-specific linker histone H1-like protein
 (termed HILS1) in the mouse and human. Both mouse and human HILS1
 genes are located in intron 8 of the α-sarcoglycan genes. HILS1 is
 highly expressed in nuclei of elongating and elongated spermatids (steps
 9-15). HILS1 displays several biochemical properties that are similar to those
 of linker histones, including the abilities to bind reconstituted
 mononucleosomes, produce a chromatosome stop during micrococcal nuclease
 digestion, and aggregate chromatin. Because HILS1 is expressed in late
 spermatids that do not contain core histones, HILS1 may participate in
 spermatid nuclear condensation through a mechanism distinct from that of
 linker histones. Because HILS1 also belongs to the large winged helix/forkhead
 protein superfamily, HILS1 may also regulate gene transcription, DNA repair,
 and/or other chromosome processes during mammalian spermiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Hexokinase is the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway and utilizes ATP to convert glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). We previously identified three variant transcripts of Hk1 that are expressed specifically in spermatogenic cells, have different 5′ untranslated regions, and encode a protein (HK1S, spermatogenic cell-specific type 1 hexokinase) in which the porin-binding domain (PBD) of HK1 is replaced by a novel N-terminal spermatogenic cell-specific region (SSR). However, the level of expression of the individual variant transcripts or of the other members of the hexokinase gene family (Hk2, Hk3, and Gck) in spermatogenic cells remains uncertain. We show that Hk1, Hk2, and Hk3 transcripts levels are quite low in spermatocytes and spermatids and Gck transcripts are relatively abundant in spermatids, but that GCK is not detected in spermatozoa. Using real time RT-PCR (qPCR) with primers specific for each of the three variant forms and RNA from whole testis and isolated germ cells, we found that transcripts for Hk1\_v2 and Hk1\_v3, but not for Hk1\_v1, are relatively high in spermatids. Similar results were seen using spermatogenic cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection (LCM). Immunoblotting studies found that HK1S is abundant in sperm, and immunostaining confirmed that HK1S is located mainly in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, where other spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic enzymes have been found. These results strongly suggest that HK1, HK2, HK3 and GCK are unlikely to have a role in glycolysis in sperm and that HK1S encoded by Hk1\_v2 and Hk1\_v3 serves this role.},

Each of the ten reactions in this pathway is typically catalyzed by multiple isozymes encoded by a multigene family. Several isozymes in this pathway are expressed only during spermatogenesis, and gene targeting studies indicate that they are essential for sperm function and male fertility in mouse. At least three of the novel glycolytic isozymes are encoded by retrogenes (Pgk2, Aldoart1, and Aldoart2). Their restricted expression profile suggests that retrotransposition may play a significant role in the evolution of sperm glycolytic enzymes.},

This study provides the first evidence for three novel aldolase isozymes in mouse sperm, two encoded by Aldoart1 and Aldoart2 retrogenes on different chromosomes and another by Aldoa\_v2, a splice variant of Aldoa. Phylogenetic analyses and comparative genomics indicate that the retrogenes and splice variant have remained functional and have been under positive selection for millions of years. Their expression is restricted to the male germline and is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. All three isozymes are present only in spermatids and sperm and have distinctive features that may be important for localization in the flagellum and/or altered metabolic regulation. Both ALDOART1 and ALDOA\_V2 have unusual N-terminal extensions not found in other aldolases. The N-terminal extension of ALDOA\_V2 is highly conserved in mammals, suggesting a conserved function in sperm. We hypothesize that the N-terminal extensions are responsible for localizing components of the glycolytic pathway to the fibrous sheath and that this localization is required to provide sufficient ATP along the length of the flagellum to support sperm motility.},

Two functional loci for the production of PGK have been identified in the mammalian genome. PGK-1 is an X-linked gene expressed constitutively in all somatic cells and premeitotic germ cells1–4.. The human PGK-1 gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns encompassing a region ∼23 kilobases (kb) in length5. PGK-2 is an autosomal gene expressed in a tissue-specific manner exclusively in the late stages of spermatogenesis3,4,6–8. In the present study, a molecular analysis of a human genomic clone of PGK-2 originally isolated by Szabo et al.9 has revealed that this autosomal sequence completely lacks introns and contains characteristics of a processed gene10,11, or 'retroposon'12,13, including the remnants of a poly(A)+ tail and bounding direct repeats. Typically such processed sequences form non-functional pseudogenes that have evolved multiple genetic lesions which preclude translation of any transcript into a functional polypeptide10. For example, an X-linked processed pseudogene of PGK-1 (ψPGK-1) in humans has been identified and shown to contain premature termination codons in all reading frames14. It was therefore unexpected to find that the intronless autosomal PGK sequence reported here is not a pseudogene, but is rather a functional gene that has retained a complete open reading frame, and is actively expressed in mammalian spermatogenesis. Both the unusual conservation of function in this processed PGK-2 gene and its tissue-specific expression in spermatogenesis are best explained as a compensatory response to the inactivation of the X-linked PGK-1 gene in spermatogenic cells before meiosis.},

  abstract = {Although glycolysis is highly conserved, it is remarkable that several unique isozymes in this central metabolic pathway are found in mammalian sperm. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-S (GAPDS) is the product of a mouse gene expressed only during spermatogenesis and, like its human ortholog (GAPD2), is the sole GAPDH isozyme in sperm. It is tightly bound to the fibrous sheath, a cytoskeletal structure that extends most of the length of the sperm flagellum. We disrupted Gapds expression by gene targeting to selectively block sperm glycolysis and assess its relative importance for in vivo sperm function. Gapds –/– males were infertile and had profound defects in sperm motility, exhibiting sluggish movement without forward progression. Although mitochondrial oxygen consumption was unchanged, sperm from Gapds –/– mice had ATP levels that were only 10.4\% of those in sperm from WT mice. These results imply that most of the energy required for sperm motility is generated by glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the critical role of glycolysis in sperm and its dependence on this sperm-specific enzyme suggest that GAPDS is a potential contraceptive target, and that mutations or environmental agents that disrupt its activity could lead to male infertility.},

  abstract = {Triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) is a member of the glycolytic pathway, which is a critical source of energy for motility in mouse sperm. By immunoblotting, we detected two male, germ line-specific TPI1 bands (Mr 33,400 and 30,800) as well as the somatic-type band (Mr 27,700). Although all three bands were observed in spermatogenic cells, somatic-type TPI1 disappeared from sperm during epididymal maturation. In vitro dephosphorylation analysis suggested that the two male, germ line-specific TPI1 bands were not the result of phosphorylation of the 27,700 Mr TPI1 band. The Mr 33,400; 30,800; and 27,700 TPI1 bands corresponded to the respective sizes of the proteins predicted to use the first, second, and third possible initiation codons of the Tpi1 cDNA. We performed immunofluorescence on epididymal sperm and determined that TPI1 specifically localized in the principal piece. The antibody staining was stronger in cauda epididymal sperm than in caput epididymal sperm, a finding consistent with the identification of TPI1 as a cauda epididymal sperm-enriched protein. Immunofluorescence with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-insoluble flagellar accessory structures showed a strong TPI1 signal only in the principal piece, indicating that TPI1 is a component of the fibrous sheath. Northern blot hybridization detected longer Tpi1 transcripts (1.56 kb) in mouse testis, whereas somatic tissues had shorter transcripts (1.32 kb). As there is only one triosephosphate isomerase gene in the mouse genome, we conclude that the three variants we see in sperm result from the use of alternative translation start codons in spermatogenic cells.

BAHD1 also localizes to the inactive X chromosome (Xi), but the functional significance of this targeting is unknown. So far, research on this protein has been hampered by its low endogenous abundance and its role in epigenetic regulation remains poorly explored. In this work, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) to compare the DNA methylation profile of HEK293 cells expressing low levels of BAHD1 (HEK-CT) to that of isogenic cells stably overexpressing BAHD1 (HEK-BAHD1). We show that increasing BAHD1 levels induces de novo DNA methylation on autosomes and a marked hypomethylation on the X chromosome (chrX). We identified 91,358 regions that have different methylation patterns in HEK-BAHD1 compared to HEK-CT cells (termed “BAHD1-DMRs”), of which 83,850 mapped on autosomes and 7,508 on the X chromosome (chrX). Autosomal BAHD1-DMRs were predominantly hypermethylated and located to satellites, interspersed repeats and intergenic regions. In contrast, BAHD1-DMRs on chrX were mainly hypomethylated and located to gene bodies and enhancers. We further found that BAHD1-DMRs display a higher-order organization by being clustered within large chromosomal domains. Half of these “BAHD1-Associated differentially methylated Domains” (BADs) overlapped with lamina-associated domains (LADs). Based on these results, we propose that BAHD1-mediated heterochromatin formation is linked to DNA methylation and may play a role in the spatial architecture of the genome.},

By intercrossing two diverged mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequencing 119 offspring, we detect thousands of crossover and non-crossover events genome-wide with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. We find that both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at DSB hotspots where the DSB-positioning protein PRDM9 fails to bind to the unbroken homologous chromosome, revealing that PRDM9 also functions to promote homologue-templated repair. Our results show that complex non-crossovers are much rarer in mice than humans, consistent with complex events arising from accumulated non-programmed DNA damage. Unexpectedly, we also find that GC-biased gene conversion is restricted to non-crossover tracts containing only one mismatch. These results demonstrate that local genetic diversity profoundly alters meiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9-related hybrid infertility.},

We further explore the role of PRDM9 in meiosis by analyzing the effect of the KRAB, SSXRD, and post-SET zinc finger deletions in a cell culture expression system and the KRAB domain deletion in mice. We found that although the post-SET zinc finger and the KRAB domains are not essential for the methyltransferase activity of PRDM9 in cell culture, the KRAB domain mutant mice show only residual PRDM9 methyltransferase activity and undergo meiotic arrest. In aggregate, our data indicate that domains typically involved in regulation of gene expression do not serve that role in PRDM9, but are likely involved in setting the proper chromatin environment for initiation and completion of homologous recombination.},

  abstract = {Hybrid sterility is one of the reproductive isolation mechanisms leading to speciation. Prdm9, the only known vertebrate hybrid-sterility gene, causes failure of meiotic chromosome synapsis and infertility in male hybrids that are the offspring of two mouse subspecies. Within species, Prdm9 determines the sites of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and meiotic recombination hotspots. To investigate the relation between Prdm9-controlled meiotic arrest and asynapsis, we inserted random stretches of consubspecific homology on several autosomal pairs in sterile hybrids, and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes and to rescue male fertility. Twenty-seven or more megabases of consubspecific (belonging to the same subspecies) homology fully restored synapsis in a given autosomal pair, and we predicted that two or more DSBs within symmetric hotspots per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. We hypothesize that impaired recombination between evolutionarily diverged chromosomes could function as one of the mechanisms of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species.},

Meisetz transcripts are detected only in germ cells entering meiotic prophase in female fetal gonads and in postnatal testis. Notably, Meisetz has catalytic activity for trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, of lysine 4 of histone H3, and a transactivation activity that depends on its methylation activity. Mice in which the Meisetz gene is disrupted show sterility in both sexes due to severe impairment of the double-stranded break repair pathway, deficient pairing of homologous chromosomes and impaired sex body formation. In Meisetz-deficient testis, trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 is attenuated and meiotic gene transcription is altered. These findings indicate that meiosis-specific epigenetic events in mammals are crucial for proper meiotic progression.},

In the presence of ATP, RecA mediates the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction that links recombining DNA molecules. DNA joint formation is initiated through the nucleation of RecA onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form helical nucleoprotein filaments. Two RecA-like recombinases, Rad51 and Dmc1, exist in eukaryotes. Whereas Rad51 is needed for both mitotic and meiotic recombination events, the function of Dmc1 is restricted to meiosis. Here we examine human Dmc1 protein (hDmc1) for the ability to promote DNA strand exchange, and show that hDmc1 mediates strand exchange between paired DNA substrates over at least several thousand base pairs. DNA strand exchange requires ATP and is strongly dependent on the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding molecule replication factor A (RPA). We present evidence that hDmc1-mediated DNA recombination initiates through the nucleation of hDmc1 onto ssDNA to form a helical nucleoprotein filament. The DNA strand exchange activity of hDmc1 is probably indispensable for repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis and for maintaining the ploidy of meiotic chromosomes.},

  abstract = {According to the Dobzhansky-Muller model, hybrid sterility is a consequence of the independent evolution of related taxa resulting in incompatible genomic interactions of their hybrids. The model implies that the incompatibilities evolve randomly, unless a particular gene or nongenic sequence diverges much faster than the rest of the genome. Here we propose that asynapsis of heterospecific chromosomes in meiotic prophase provides a recurrently evolving trigger for the meiotic arrest of interspecific F1 hybrids. We observed extensive asynapsis of chromosomes and disturbance of the sex body in ¿95\% of pachynemas of Mus m. musculus × Mus m. domesticus sterile F1 males. Asynapsis was not preceded by a failure of double-strand break induction, and the rate of meiotic crossing over was not affected in synapsed chromosomes. DNA double-strand break repair was delayed or failed in unsynapsed autosomes, and misexpression of chromosome X and chromosome Y genes was detected in single pachynemas and by genome-wide expression profiling. Oocytes of F1 hybrid females showed the same kind of synaptic problems but with the incidence reduced to half. Most of the oocytes with pachytene asynapsis were eliminated before birth. We propose the heterospecific pairing of homologous chromosomes as a preexisting condition of asynapsis in interspecific hybrids. The asynapsis may represent a universal mechanistic basis of F1 hybrid sterility manifested by pachytene arrest. It is tempting to speculate that a fast-evolving subset of the noncoding genomic sequence important for chromosome pairing and synapsis may be the culprit.},

Structural studies reveal that PWWP domains possess a conserved aromatic cage for histone methyl-lysine recognition, and synergistically bind both histone and DNA, which contributes to their nucleosome-binding ability and chromatin localization. Furthermore, the PWWP domain often cooperates with other histone and DNA 'reader' or 'modifier' domains to evoke crosstalk between various epigenetic marks.

Combining this map with molecular assays measuring stages of recombination, we identified factors that affect crossover probability, including PRDM9 binding on the non-initiating template homolog and telomere proximity. These factors also influence the time for sites of recombination-initiating DNA double-strand breaks to find and engage their homologs, with rapidly engaging sites more likely to form crossovers. We show that chromatin environment on the template homolog affects positioning of crossover breakpoints. Our results also offer insights into recombination in the pseudoautosomal region.},

In many eukaryotes, sites of meiotic recombination, also called hotspots, are regions of accessible chromatin, but in many vertebrates, their location follows a distinct pattern and is specified by PR domain-containing protein 9 (PRDM9). The specification of meiotic recombination hotspots is achieved by the different activities of PRDM9: DNA binding, histone methyltransferase, and interaction with other proteins. Remarkably, PRDM9 activity leads to the erosion of its own binding sites and the rapid evolution of its DNA-binding domain. PRDM9 may also contribute to reproductive isolation, as it is involved in hybrid sterility potentially due to a reduction of its activity in specific heterozygous contexts.},

However, how telomeres are modified to mediate chromosome movement is largely elusive. Here we show that mammalian meiotic telomeres are fundamentally modified by a meiosis-specific Myb-domain protein, TERB1, that localizes at telomeres in mouse germ cells. TERB1 forms a heterocomplex with the canonical telomeric protein TRF1 and binds telomere repeat DNA. Disruption of Terb1 in mice abolishes meiotic chromosomal movement and impairs homologous pairing and synapsis, causing infertility in both sexes. TERB1 promotes telomere association with the nuclear envelope and deposition of the SUN-KASH complex, which recruits cytoplasmic motor complexes. TERB1 also binds and recruits cohesin to telomeres to develop structural rigidity, strikingly reminiscent of centromeres. Our study suggests that TERB1 acts as a central hub for the assembly of a conserved meiotic telomere complex required for chromosome movements.},

The method combines profile-profile alignments with secondary-structure specific gap-penalties, classic pair- and solvation potentials using a linear combination optimized with a regression SVM model. We find this combination significantly improves both detection of useful templates and accuracy of sequence-structure alignments relative to other competitive approaches. We further present a second implementation of the protocol designed for the task of discriminating superfamilies from one another. This method, pDomTHREADER, is the first to incorporate both sequence and structural data directly in this task and improves sensitivity and selectivity over the standard version of pGenTHREADER and three other standard methods for remote homology detection.},

Males and females produce different end products of meiosis: eggs (females) and sperm (males). In addition, these unique end products demonstrate sex-specific differences that occur throughout meiosis to produce the final genetic material that is packaged into distinct gametes with unique extracellular morphologies and nuclear sizes. These sexually dimorphic features of meiosis include the meiotic chromosome architecture, in which both the lengths of the chromosomes and the requirement for specific meiotic axis proteins being different between the sexes. Moreover, these changes likely cause sex-specific changes in the recombination landscape with the sex that has the longer chromosomes usually obtaining more crossovers. Additionally, epigenetic regulation of meiosis may contribute to sexually dimorphic recombination landscapes. Here we explore the sexually dimorphic features of both the chromosome axis and crossing over for each stage of meiotic prophase I in Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we consider how sex-specific changes in the meiotic chromosome axes and the epigenetic landscape may function together to regulate crossing over in each sex, indicating that the mechanisms controlling crossing over may be different in oogenesis and spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {A hallmark of meiosis is the rearrangement of parental alleles to ensure genetic diversity in the gametes. These chromosome rearrangements are mediated by the repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as genetic crossovers between parental homologs. In mice, humans, and many other mammals, meiotic DSBs occur primarily at hotspots, determined by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Without PRDM9, meiotic DSBs occur near gene promoters and other functional sites. Studies in a limited number of mouse strains showed that functional PRDM9 is required to complete meiosis, but despite its apparent importance, has been repeatedly lost across many animal lineages. Both the reason for mouse sterility in the absence of PRDM9 and the mechanism by which can be lost remain unclear. Here, we explore whether mice can tolerate the loss of By generating functional knockouts in an array of genetic backgrounds, we observe a wide range of fertility phenotypes and ultimately demonstrate that PRDM9 is not required for completion of male meiosis. Although DSBs still form at a common subset of functional sites in all mice lacking PRDM9, meiotic outcomes differ substantially. We speculate that DSBs at functional sites are difficult to repair as a crossover and that by increasing the efficiency of crossover formation at these sites, genetic modifiers of recombination rates can allow for meiotic progression. This model implies that species with a sufficiently high recombination rate may lose yet remain fertile.},

Pairing of homologous chromosomes is facilitated by telomere-led chromosome movements and formation of a meiotic bouquet, where telomeres cluster to one pole of the nucleus. In metazoans, telomere clustering is dynein and microtubule dependent and requires Sun1, an inner nuclear membrane protein. Here we provide a functional analysis of KASH5, a mammalian dynein-binding protein of the outer nuclear membrane that forms a meiotic complex with Sun1. This protein is related to zebrafish futile cycle (Fue), a nuclear envelope (NE) constituent required for pronuclear migration. Mice deficient in this Fue homologue are infertile. Males display meiotic arrest in which pairing of homologous chromosomes fails. These findings demonstrate that telomere attachment to the NE is insufficient to promote pairing and that telomere attachment sites must be coupled to cytoplasmic dynein and the microtubule system to ensure meiotic progression.},

We find evidence for both GC-biased gene conversion and mutagenesis around meiotic DSB hotspots, while frequent colocalization of DSB hotspots with chromosome rearrangement breakpoints implicates the aberrant repair of meiotic DSBs in genomic disorders. Furthermore, our data indicate that DSB frequency is a major determinant of crossover rate.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies link H3-lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation to HP1-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. However, the mechanisms that target and coordinate these activities to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we report that the KAP-1 corepressor for the KRAB-ZFP superfamily of transcriptional silencers binds to SETDB1, a novel SET domain protein with histone H3-K9-specific methyltransferase activity. Although acetylation and phosphorylation of the H3 N-terminal tail profoundly affect the efficiency of H3-K9 methylation by SETDB1, we found that methylation of H3-K4 does not affect SETDB1-mediated methylation of H3-K9. In vitro methylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 by SETDB1 is sufficient to enhance the binding of HP1 proteins, which requires both an intact chromodomain and chromoshadow domain. Indirect immunofluoresence staining of interphase nuclei localized SETDB1 predominantly in euchromatic regions that overlap with HP1 staining in nonpericentromeric regions of chromatin. Moreover, KAP-1, SETDB1, H3-MeK9, and HP1 are enriched at promoter sequences of a euchromatic gene silenced by the KRAB-KAP-1 repression system. Thus, KAP-1 is a molecular scaffold that is targeted by KRAB-ZFPs to specific loci and coordinates both histone methylation and the deposition of HP1 proteins to silence gene expression.},

Unlike autosomes or female sex chromosomes, human male sex chromosomes X and Y share little homology. Although DSBs are generated throughout male sex chromosomes, homologous recombination does not occur for most regions and DSB repair process is significantly prolonged. As a result, male sex chromosomes are coated with many DNA damage response proteins and form a unique chromatin structure known as the XY body. Interestingly, associated with the prolonged DSB repair, transcription is repressed in the XY body but not in autosomes, a phenomenon known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which is critical for male meiosis. Here using mice as model organisms, we briefly summarize recent progress on DSB repair in meiotic prophase and focus on the mechanism and function of DNA damage response in the XY body.},

Most, if not all, of these early interactions are eliminated as prophase progresses. The manner in which these sites are eliminated is the focus of this investigation. We report that these sites acquire replication protein A, RPA and the Escherichia coli MUTS homologue, MSH4p, and somewhat later the Bloom helicase, BLM, while simultaneously losing the RAD51/DMC1 component. Eventually the RPA component is also lost and BLM sites remain. At that time, the MUTL homologue, MLH1p, which is essential for reciprocal recombination in the mouse, appears in numbers and locations that correspond to the distribution of reciprocal recombination events. However, the MLH1 foci do not appear to coincide with the remaining BLM sites. The MLH1p is specifically localized to electron-microscope-defined recombination nodules. We consider the possibility that the homology-search RAD51/DMC1 complexes are involved in homologous chromosome synapsis but that most of these early DNA-DNA interactions are later resolved by the anti-recombination RPA/MSH4/BLM-topoisomerase complex, thereby preventing the formation of superfluous reciprocal recombinant events.},

  abstract = {Almost all protein database search methods use amino acid substitution matrices for scoring, optimizing, and assessing the statistical significance of sequence alignments. Much care and effort has therefore gone into constructing substitution matrices, and the quality of search results can depend strongly upon the choice of the proper matrix. A long-standing problem has been the comparison of sequences with biased amino acid compositions, for which standard substitution matrices are not optimal. To address this problem, we have recently developed a general procedure for transforming a standard matrix into one appropriate for the comparison of two sequences with arbitrary, and possibly differing compositions. Such adjusted matrices yield, on average, improved alignments and alignment scores when applied to the comparison of proteins with markedly biased compositions. Here we review the application of compositionally adjusted matrices and consider whether they may also be applied fruitfully to general purpose protein sequence database searches, in which related sequence pairs do not necessarily have strong compositional biases. Although it is not advisable to apply compositional adjustment indiscriminately, we describe several simple criteria under which invoking such adjustment is on average beneficial. In a typical database search, at least one of these criteria is satisfied by over half the related sequence pairs. Compositional substitution matrix adjustment is now available in NCBI's protein-protein version of blast.},

This sexual dimorphism implies that the processes of recombination and homologous chromosome pairing, while being controlled by similar genetic pathways, are subject to different levels of checkpoint control in males and females. This review is focused on the emerging picture of sexual dimorphism exhibited by mammalian germ cells using evidence from the broad range of meiotic mutants now available in the mouse. Many of these mouse mutants display distinct differences in meiotic progression and/or dysfunction in males versus females, and their continued study will allow us to understand the molecular basis for the sex-specific differences observed during prophase I progression.},

To allow a comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate recombination. Here we present the genome-wide distribution of recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome. Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately 200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of the fine structural details of the preferred recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that the vast majority of recombination initiation sites in mouse males are associated with testis-specific trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks associated with transcription. The recombination map presented here has been derived from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined genetic background and therefore lends itself to extensive future experimental exploration. We note that the mapping technique developed here does not depend on the availability of genetic markers and hence can be easily adapted to other species with complex genomes. Our findings uncover several fundamental features of mammalian recombination hotspots and underline the power of the new recombination map for future studies of genetic recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

The number and distribution of crossovers are tightly controlled, but the factors that contribute to this control are poorly understood in most organisms, including mammals. Here we provide evidence that the ATM kinase or protein is essential for proper crossover formation in mouse spermatocytes. ATM deficiency causes multiple phenotypes in humans and mice, including gonadal atrophy. Mouse Atm-/- spermatocytes undergo apoptosis at mid-prophase of meiosis I, but Atm(-/-) meiotic phenotypes are partially rescued by Spo11 heterozygosity, such that ATM-deficient spermatocytes progress to meiotic metaphase I. Strikingly, Spo11+/-Atm-/- spermatocytes are defective in forming the obligate crossover on the sex chromosomes, even though the XY pair is usually incorporated in a sex body and is transcriptionally inactivated as in normal spermatocytes. The XY crossover defect correlates with the appearance of lagging chromosomes at metaphase I, which may trigger the extensive metaphase apoptosis that is observed in these cells. In addition, control of the number and distribution of crossovers on autosomes appears to be defective in the absence of ATM because there is an increase in the total number of MLH1 foci, which mark the sites of eventual crossover formation, and because interference between MLH1 foci is perturbed. The axes of autosomes exhibit structural defects that correlate with the positions of ongoing recombination. Together, these findings indicate that ATM plays a role in both crossover control and chromosome axis integrity and further suggests that ATM is important for coordinating these features of meiotic chromosome dynamics.},

  abstract = {The neuronal gene repressor REST/NRSF recruits corepressors, including CoREST, to modify histones and repress transcription. REST also functions as a tumor suppressor, but the mechanism remains unclear. We identified chromodomain on Y-like (CDYL) as a REST corepressor that physically bridges REST and the histone methylase G9a to repress transcription. Importantly, RNAi knockdown of REST, CDYL, and G9a, but not CoREST, induced oncogenic transformation of immortalized primary human cells and derepression of the proto-oncogene TrkC. Significantly, transgenic expression of TrkC also induced transformation. This implicates CDYL-G9a, but not CoREST, in REST suppression of transformation, possibly by oncogene repression. CDYL knockdown also augments transformation in a cell culture model of cervical cancer, where loss of heterozygosity of the CDYL locus occurs. These findings demonstrate molecular strategies by which REST carries out distinct biological functions via different corepressors and provide critical insights into the role of histone-modifying complexes in regulating cellular transformation.},

  abstract = {Mammalian meiotic progression, like mitotic cell cycle progression, is regulated by cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). However, the unique requirements of meiosis (homologous synapsis, reciprocal recombination and the dual divisions that segregate first homologues, then sister chromatids) have led to different patterns of CDK expression. Here we show that Cdk4 colocalizes with replication protein A (RPA) on the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of newly synapsed axes of homologously pairing bivalents, but disappears from these axes by mid-pachynema. The switch from the mitotic pattern of expression occurs during the last two spermatogonial divisions. Cdk2 colocalizes with MLH1, a mismatch repair protein at sites of reciprocal recombination in mid-late pachynema. In addition Cdk2 localizes to the telomeres of chromosomal bivalents throughout meiotic prophase. The mitotic pattern of expression of Cdk2 remains unchanged throughout the spermatogonial divisions, but is altered in meiosis of the spermatocytes.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

  abstract = {Modulating chromatin through histone methylation orchestrates numerous cellular processes. SETD2-dependent trimethylation of histone H3K36 is associated with active transcription. Here, we define a role for H3K36 trimethylation in homologous recombination (HR) repair in human cells. We find that depleting SETD2 generates a mutation signature resembling RAD51 depletion at I-SceI-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, with significantly increased deletions arising through microhomology-mediated end-joining. We establish a presynaptic role for SETD2 methyltransferase in HR, where it facilitates the recruitment of C-terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) and promotes DSB resection, allowing Replication Protein A (RPA) and RAD51 binding to DNA damage sites. Furthermore, reducing H3K36me3 levels by overexpressing KDM4A/JMJD2A, an oncogene and H3K36me3/2 demethylase, or an H3.3K36M transgene also reduces HR repair events. We propose that error-free HR repair within H3K36me3-decorated transcriptionally active genomic regions promotes cell homeostasis. Moreover, these findings provide insights as to why oncogenic mutations cluster within the H3K36me3 axis.},

The mechanism of this requirement is, however, not understood. The previous studies in Saccharomyces suggested that Hop2 is a guardian of meiotic chromosome synapsis with the ability to prevent or resolve deleterious associations between nonhomologous chromosomes. We have generated a Hop2 knockout mouse that shows profound meiotic defects with a distinct and novel phenotype. Hop2−/− spermatocytes arrest at the stage of pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements are fully developed, but synapsis of any kind is very limited. Immunofluorescence analysis of meiotic chromosome spreads indicates that while meiotic double-stranded breaks are formed and processed in the Hop2 knockout, they fail to be repaired. In aggregate, the Hop2 phenotype is consistent with a direct role for the mouse Hop2 protein in promoting homologous chromosome synapsis.},

  abstract = {The first decade of genome sequencing stimulated an explosion in the characterization of unknown proteins. More recently, the pace of functional discovery has slowed, leaving around 20\% of the proteins even in well-studied model organisms without informative descriptions of their biological roles. Remarkably, many uncharacterized proteins are conserved from yeasts to human, suggesting that they contribute to fundamental biological processes (BP). To fully understand biological systems in health and disease, we need to account for every part of the system. Unstudied proteins thus represent a collective blind spot that limits the progress of both basic and applied biosciences. We use a simple yet powerful metric based on Gene Ontology BP terms to define characterized and uncharacterized proteins for human, budding yeast and fission yeast. We then identify a set of conserved but unstudied proteins in S. pombe, and classify them based on a combination of orthogonal attributes determined by large-scale experimental and comparative methods. Finally, we explore possible reasons why these proteins remain neglected, and propose courses of action to raise their profile and thereby reap the benefits of completing the catalogue of proteins’ biological roles.},

Fertility declines well before general signs of menopause and is also adversely affected by common reproductive diseases, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis. Understanding the factors that regulate the timing of puberty and menopause, and the relationships with fertility are important for individuals and for policy. Substantial genetic variation exists for common traits associated with reproductive lifespan and for common diseases influencing female fertility. Genetic studies have identified mutations in genes contributing to disorders of reproduction, and in the last ten years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of common genetic contributions to these complex traits and diseases. These studies have made great progress towards understanding the genetic factors contributing to variation in traits and diseases influencing female fertility. The data emerging from GWAS demonstrate the utility of genetics to explain epidemiological observations, revealing shared biological pathways linking puberty timing, fertility, reproductive ageing and health outcomes. Many variants implicate DNA damage/repair genes in variation in the age at menopause with implications for follicle health and ageing. In addition to the discovery of individual genes and pathways, the increasingly powerful studies on common genetic risk factors help interpret the underlying relationships and direction of causation in the regulation of reproductive lifespan, fertility and related traits.},

protein structure determination. With the overall funding on the order of \$2
billion (in 2010 dollars), the structural genomics (SG) consortia established worldwide
have developed pipelines for target selection, protein production, sample preparation,
crystallization, and structure determination by X-ray crystallography and NMR. These
efforts resulted in the determination of over 13,500 protein structures, mostly from
unique protein families, and increased the structural coverage of the expanding protein
universe. SG programs contributed over 4,400 publications to the scientific literature.
The NIH-funded Protein Structure Initiatives (PSI) alone have produced over 2,000
scientific publications, which to date have attracted more than 93,000 citations. Software
and database developments that were necessary to handle high-throughput structure
determination workflows have led to structures of better quality and improved integrity of
the associated data. Organized and accessible data have a positive impact on the
reproducibility of scientific experiments. Most of the experimental data generated by the
SG centers are freely available to the community and has been utilized by scientists in
various fields of research. SG projects have created, improved, streamlined, and validated
many protocols for protein production and crystallization, data collection, and functional
analysis, significantly benefiting biological and biomedical research.},

The National Institutes of Health-supported Protein Structure Initiative and related worldwide structural genomics efforts facilitate functional annotation of proteins through structural characterization. Recently there have been profound changes in the taxonomic composition of sequence databases, which are effectively redefining the scope and contribution of these large-scale structure-based efforts. The faster-growing bacterial genomic entries have overtaken the eukaryotic entries over the last 5 y, but also have become more redundant. Despite the enormous increase in the number of sequences, the overall structural coverage of proteins—including proteins for which reliable homology models can be generated—on the residue level has increased from 30\% to 40\% over the last 10 y. Structural genomics efforts contributed ∼50\% of this new structural coverage, despite determining only ∼10\% of all new structures. Based on current trends, it is expected that ∼55\% structural coverage (the level required for significant functional insight) will be achieved within 15 y, whereas without structural genomics efforts, realizing this goal will take approximately twice as long.},

  abstract = {Quantification of evolutionary constraints via sequence conservation can be leveraged to annotate genomic functional sequences. Recent efforts addressing the converse of this relationship have identified many sites in metazoan genomes with molecular function but without detectable conservation between related species. Here, we discuss explanations and implications for these results considering both practical and theoretical issues. In particular, phylogenetic scope influences the relationship between sequence conservation and function. Comparisons of distantly related species can detect constraint with high specificity due to the loss of conserved neutral sequence, but sensitivity is sacrificed as a result of functional changes related to lineage-specific biology. The strength of natural selection operating on functional sequence is also important. Mutations to functional sequences that result in small fitness effects are subject to weaker constraints. Therefore, particularly when comparing highly divergent species, functional sequences that are degenerate or biologically redundant will be prone to turnover, wherein functional sequences are replaced by effectively equivalent, but nonorthologous counterparts. Finally, considering the size and complexity of metazoan genomes and the fact that many nonconserved sequences are associated with sequence-degenerate, low-level molecular functions, we find it likely that there exist many biochemically functional sequences that are not under constraint. This hypothesis does not lead to the conclusion that huge amounts of vertebrate genomes are functionally important, but rather that such “functionality” represents molecular noise that has weak or no effect on organismal phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Protein structures change during evolution in response to mutations. Here, we analyze the mapping between sequence and structure in a set of structurally aligned protein domains. To avoid artifacts, we restricted our attention only to the core components of these structures. We found that on average, using different measures of structural change, protein cores evolve linearly with evolutionary distance (amino acid substitutions per site). This is true irrespective of which measure of structural change we used, whether RMSD or discrete structural descriptors for secondary structure, accessibility, or contacts. This linear response allows us to quantify the claim that structure is more conserved than sequence. Using structural alphabets of similar cardinality to the sequence alphabet, structural cores evolve three to ten times slower than sequences. Although we observed an average linear response, we found a wide variance. Different domain families varied fivefold in structural response to evolution. An attempt to categorically analyze this variance among subgroups by structural and functional category revealed only one statistically significant trend. This trend can be explained by the fact that beta-sheets change faster than alpha-helices, most likely due to that they are shorter and that change occurs at the ends of the secondary structure elements.

As sequence and structure databases become larger, and comparison methods become more powerful, reliable statistical estimates will become even more important for distinguishing similarities that are due to homology from those that are due to analogy (convergence).

We found low consistency between enrichment analyses results obtained with early and more recent GO versions. Furthermore, there continues to be a~strong annotation bias in the GO annotations where 58\% of the annotations are for 16\% of the human genes. Our analysis suggests that GO evolution may have affected the interpretation and possibly reproducibility of experiments over time.

To assess whether this goal is being met, we quantified the effect of GWAS on the overall distribution of biomedical research publications and on the subsequent publication history of genes newly associated with complex disease. We found that the historical skew of publications toward genes involved in Mendelian disease has not changed since the advent of GWAS. Genes newly implicated by GWAS in complex disease do experience additional publications compared to control genes, and they are more likely to become exceptionally studied.

A single change in DNA, RNA, proteins or cellular images can be useful as a biomarker of disease onset or progression. With high-throughput molecular phenotyping of single cells, it is now conceivable that the molecular changes occurring across thousands, or tens of thousands, of individual cells could additionally be considered as a disease biomarker. Transition to a disease state would then be reflected by the shifts in cell numbers and locations across a multidimensional space that is defined by the molecular content of cells. Realising this ambition requires a robust formulation of such a multidimensional ‘cell space’. This is one of the goals of the recently launched Human Cell Atlas project. A second goal is to populate this ‘cell space’ with all cell types in the human body.

This approach produces a drastic signal increase in RNA FISH samples without increasing the fluorescent spot size for individual RNAs or increasing the variation in brightness from spot to spot, properties that are important for MERFISH imaging. Using this amplification approach in combination with MERFISH, we demonstrated RNA imaging and profiling with a near 100\% detection efficiency. We further demonstrated that signal amplification improves MERFISH performance when fewer FISH probes are used for each RNA species, which should allow shorter RNAs to be imaged. We anticipate that the combination of bDNA amplification with MERFISH should facilitate many other applications and extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by this technique in both cell culture and tissues.},

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION The copy number and intracellular localization of RNA are important regulators of gene expression. Measurement of these properties at the transcriptome scale in single cells will give answers to many questions related to gene expression and regulation. Single-molecule RNA imaging approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), are powerful tools for counting and mapping RNA; however, the number of RNA species that can be simultaneously imaged in individual cells has been limited. This makes it challenging to perform transcriptomic analysis of single cells in a spatially resolved manner. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging method that allows thousands of RNA species to be imaged in single cells by using combinatorial FISH labeling with encoding schemes capable of detecting and/or correcting errors.
RATIONALE We labeled each cellular RNA with a set of encoding probes, which contain targeting sequences that bind the RNA and readout sequences that bind fluorescently labeled readout probes. Each RNA species is encoded with a particular combination of readout sequences. We used successive rounds of hybridization and imaging, each with a different readout probe, to identify the readout sequences bound to each RNA and to decode the RNA. In principle, combinatorial labeling allows the number of detectable RNA species to grow exponentially with the number of imaging rounds, but the detection errors also increase exponentially. To combat such accumulating errors, we exploited error-robust encoding schemes used in digital electronics, such as the extended Hamming code, in the design of our encoding probes but modified these schemes in order to account for the error properties in FISH measurements. We assigned each RNA a binary word in our modified Hamming code and encoded the RNA with a combination of readout sequences according to this binary word.
RESULTS We first imaged 140 RNA species in human fibroblast cells using MERFISH with 16 rounds of hybridization and a modified Hamming code capable of both error detection and correction. We obtained \textasciitilde{}80\% detection efficiency and observed excellent correlation of RNA copy numbers determined with MERFISH with both bulk RNA sequencing data and conventional smFISH measurements of individual genes. Next, we used an alternative MERFISH encoding scheme, which is capable of detecting but not correcting errors, to image 1001 RNA species in individual cells using only 14 rounds of hybridization. The observed RNA copy numbers again correlate well with bulk sequencing data. However, the detection efficiency is only one-third that of the error-correcting encoding scheme. We performed correlation analysis of the 104 to 106 pairs of measured genes and identified many covarying gene groups that share common regulatory elements. Such grouping allowed us to hypothesize potential functions of \textasciitilde{}100 unannotated or partially annotated genes of unknown functions. We further analyzed correlations in the spatial distributions of different RNA species and identified groups of RNAs with different distribution patterns in the cell.
DISCUSSION This highly multiplexed imaging approach enables analyses based on the variation and correlation of copy numbers and spatial distributions of a large number of RNA species within single cells. Such analyses should facilitate the delineation of regulatory networks and in situ identification of cell types. We envision that this approach will allow spatially resolved transcriptomes to be determined for single cells. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/348/6233/aaa6090/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint MERFISH for transcriptome imaging. Numerous RNA species can be identified, counted, and localized in a single cell by using MERFISH, a single-molecule imaging approach that uses combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging with encoding schemes capable of detection and/or correction of errors. This highly multiplexed measurement of individual RNAs can be used to compute the gene expression profile and noise, covariation in expression among different genes, and spatial distribution of RNAs within single cells.
Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the \textasciitilde{}104 to 106 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.
A single-molecule imaging method allows simultaneous measurement of 1000 RNA species in single cells.

These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.},

Image-based transcriptomic approaches provide powerful means to measure both expression and spatial information of RNAs in individual cells within their native environment. Among these approaches, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) has achieved spatially resolved RNA quantification at transcriptome scale by massively multiplexing single-molecule FISH measurements. Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80\% detection efficiency and ∼4\% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells. We envision that the ability to perform spatially resolved, genome-wide RNA profiling with high detection efficiency and accuracy by MERFISH could help address a wide array of questions ranging from the regulation of gene expression in cells to the development of cell fate and organization in tissues.},

A low level of gene amplification was also detected in premeiotic nuclei (oogonia).},

Here, we demonstrate a multiplexed single-molecule \emph{in situ} method, intron seqFISH, that allows imaging of 10,421 genes at their nascent transcription active sites in single cells, followed by mRNA and lncRNA seqFISH and immunofluorescence. This nascent transcriptome-profiling method can identify different cell types and states with mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. The nascent sites of RNA synthesis tend to be localized on the surfaces of chromosome territories, and their organization in individual cells is highly variable. Surprisingly, the global nascent transcription oscillated asynchronously in individual cells with a period of 2 hr in mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as in fibroblasts. Together, spatial genomics of the nascent transcriptome by intron seqFISH reveals nuclear organizational principles and fast dynamics in single cells that are otherwise obscured.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Real-time PCR has become one of the most widely used methods of gene quantitation because it has a large dynamic range, boasts tremendous sensitivity, can be highly sequence-specific, has little to no post-amplification processing, and is amenable to increasing sample throughput. However, optimal benefit from these advantages requires a clear understanding of the many options available for running a real-time PCR experiment. Starting with the theory behind real-time PCR, this review discusses the key components of a real-time PCR experiment, including one-step or two-step PCR, absolute versus relative quantitation, mathematical models available for relative quantitation and amplification efficiency calculations, types of normalization or data correction, and detection chemistries. In addition, the many causes of variation as well as methods to calculate intra- and inter-assay variation are addressed.},

We therefore developed an internally controlled real-time reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR assay that quantifies HIV-1 RNA concentrations down to 1 copy per ml of plasma. This assay with single-copy sensitivity (the single-copy assay) generates a reproducible linear regression plot of input copy number versus threshold cycle by using HIV-1 RNA transcripts at copy numbers ranging from 1 to 106 per reaction mixture. The single-copy assay was compared to the ultrasensitive AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR assay and a more sensitive modification of the ultrasensitive assay by repeatedly testing a low-copy-number panel containing 200 to 0.781 copies of HIV-1 RNA per ml of plasma. This comparison showed that the single-copy assay had a greater sensitivity than the other assays and was the only assay that detected HIV-1 RNA at levels as low as 0.781 copies/ml. Testing of plasma samples from 15 patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy and who had {$<$}75 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml revealed persistent viremia in all 15 patients, with HIV-1 RNA levels ranging from 1 to 32 copies/ml (median, 13 copies/ml). The greater sensitivity of the single-copy assay should allow better characterization of persistent viremia in patients who are receiving antiretroviral therapy and whose HIV-1 RNA levels are suppressed to below the detection limits of present assays.},

The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a standard for recording and reporting microarray-based gene expression data, which will in turn facilitate the establishment of databases and public repositories and enable the development of data analysis tools.

We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3′-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.
A more complete catalog of transcribed DNA of yeast is assembled by shotgun sequencing of messenger RNA and reveals numerous previously unknown transcribed regions.

  abstract = {To demonstrate the benefits of RNA-Seq over microarray in transcriptome profiling, both RNA-Seq and microarray analyses were performed on RNA samples from a human T cell activation experiment. In contrast to other reports, our analyses focused on the difference, rather than similarity, between RNA-Seq and microarray technologies in transcriptome profiling. A comparison of data sets derived from RNA-Seq and Affymetrix platforms using the same set of samples showed a high correlation between gene expression profiles generated by the two platforms. However, it also demonstrated that RNA-Seq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts, differentiating biologically critical isoforms, and allowing the identification of genetic variants. RNA-Seq also demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, which allowed for the detection of more differentially expressed genes with higher fold-change. Analysis of the two datasets also showed the benefit derived from avoidance of technical issues inherent to microarray probe performance such as cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization and limited detection range of individual probes. Because RNA-Seq does not rely on a pre-designed complement sequence detection probe, it is devoid of issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplified interpretation of the data. Despite the superior benefits of RNA-Seq, microarrays are still the more common choice of researchers when conducting transcriptional profiling experiments. This is likely because RNA-Seq sequencing technology is new to most researchers, more expensive than microarray, data storage is more challenging and analysis is more complex. We expect that once these barriers are overcome, the RNA-Seq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis.},

Spatial transcriptomics can link molecularly described cell types to their anatomical positions and functional roles. Moffitt et al. used a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing and MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) to map the identity and location of specific cell types within the mouse preoptic hypothalamus and surrounding areas of the brain (see the Perspective by Tasic and Nicovich). They related these cell types to specific behaviors via gene activity. The approach provides an unbiased description of cell types of the preoptic area, which are important for sleep, thermoregulation, thirst, and social behavior.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONA mechanistic understanding of brain function requires the identification of distinct cell types in the brain at a molecular, spatial, and functional level. The preoptic region of the hypothalamus comprises multiple nuclei and controls many social behaviors and homeostatic functions. Discrete neuronal types within the preoptic region have been associated with specific hypothalamic behaviors and homeostatic controls, yet the organizational principles of the underlying circuits remain elusive. Further progress requires methods that can identify molecularly distinct cell types and map their spatial and functional organization in the tissue.
RATIONALESingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the understanding of many tissues by allowing a systematic, genome-wide molecular identification of cell types. However, scRNA-seq requires cell dissociation, leading to a loss of spatial context that is essential to understand the cellular architecture of brain circuits. Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling of individual cells within their native tissue and offers opportunities for simultaneous in situ cell-type identification and spatial mapping, as well as functional characterization when combined with activity marker imaging. The combination of these complementary techniques would allow us to generate a molecular inventory of neuronal types while mapping their spatial and functional organization.
RESULTSWe combined scRNA-seq and multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-cell transcriptome imaging method, to investigate the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled \textasciitilde{}31,000 cells using scRNA-seq and imaged \textasciitilde{}1.1 million cells within intact tissues using MERFISH. Our data revealed a remarkable diversity of neurons in this region, comprising \textasciitilde{}70 different neuronal populations, many of which were previously unknown. These neuronal types exhibited distinct neuromodulatory signatures and revealed a striking heterogeneity within cell populations that were previously thought to be functionally unitary. MERFISH measurements further allowed us to map the spatial organization of these neuronal types, determine the cellular composition of distinct nuclei, and provide insights into the functional organization of neuron populations, including topographical relationships that underlie sex hormone signaling.Last, we combined MERFISH with immediate-early-gene expression imaging to identify specific neuronal populations activated by social behaviors, including parenting, mating, and aggression. Several neuronal populations were selectively activated in each of these behaviors, supporting the notion that transcriptionally distinct neuronal types control specific hypothalamic functions. We identified a core neuronal population activated in all animals that exhibit parenting, as well as cell populations differentially activated in mothers and fathers, providing insights into how physiological state may affect parental behavior. Moreover, we identified cells associated with sexual behavior in males and females as well as male aggression toward infants and conspecific males.
CONCLUSIONBy combining MERFISH with scRNA-seq, we have revealed the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of neurons within the hypothalamic preoptic region. These results provide a framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits with high molecular and spatial resolution and opens avenues for identifying and mapping cell types in a diverse range of tissues and organisms. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6416/eaau5324/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint In situ single-cell profiling reveals the molecular and cellular organization of the hypothalamic preoptic region.The combination of MERFISH with scRNA-seq to profile the gene expression of 1 million cells in situ revealed \textasciitilde{}70 neuronal populations in the preoptic region, each with distinct molecular signatures and spatial organizations, providing insights into neuromodulatory signaling pathways. Further combination with activity marker imaging led to the identification of discrete neuronal types activated by key social behaviors, including parenting, aggression, and mating.
The hypothalamus controls essential social behaviors and homeostatic functions. However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei—including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types—is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled \textasciitilde{}1 million cells, identified \textasciitilde{}70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.
A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic study of an essential brain region yields a functionally annotated cell atlas.

  abstract = {In multicellular organisms, biological function emerges when heterogeneous cell types form complex organs. Nevertheless, dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.
Introducing MARS-Seq
Immune cells are typically differentiated by surface markers; however, this designation is somewhat crude and does not allow for fine distinctions that might be characterized by their RNA transcripts. Jaitin et al. (p. 776) used massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-Seq) analysis to explore cellular heterogeneity within the immune system by assembling an automated experimental platform that enables RNA profiling of cells sorted from tissues using flow cytometry. More than 1000 cells could be sequenced, and unsupervised clustering analysis of the RNA profiles revealed distinct cellular groupings that corresponded to B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This approach provides the ability to perform a bottom-up characterization of in vivo cell-type landscapes independent of cell markers or prior knowledge.
Sequencing of RNA from thousands of individual immune cells allows unbiased identification of cellular subtypes.

We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us~to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.

To understand why cells differ from each other, we need to understand which genes are transcribed at a single-cell level. Several methods measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in single cells, but most are limited to relatively low numbers of cells or genes. Fan et al. labeled each mRNA molecule in a cell with both a cellular barcode and a molecular barcode. Further analysis did not then require single-cell technologies. Instead, the labeled mRNA from all cells was pooled, amplified, and sequenced, and the gene expression profile of individual cells was reconstructed based on the barcodes. The technique successfully revealed heterogeneity across several thousand blood cells.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION The measurement of specific proteins and transcripts in individual cells is critical for understanding the role of cellular diversity in development, health, and disease. Flow cytometry has become a standard technology for high-throughput detection of protein markers on single cells and has been widely adopted in basic research and clinical diagnostics. In contrast, nucleic acid measurements such as mRNA expression are typically conducted on bulk samples, obscuring the contributions from individual cells. Ideally, in order to characterize the complexity of cellular systems, it is desirable to have an affordable approach to examine the expression of a large number of genes across many thousands of cells.
RATIONALE Here, we have developed a scalable approach that enables routine, digital gene expression profiling of thousands of single cells across an arbitrary number of genes, without using robotics or automation. The approach, termed “CytoSeq,\#x201D; employs a recursive Poisson strategy. First, single cells are randomly deposited into an array of picoliter wells. A combinatorial library of beads bearing cell- and transcript-barcoding capture probes is then added so that each cell is partitioned alongside a bead. The bead library has a diversity of \textasciitilde{}106 so that each cell is paired with a unique cell barcode, whereas the transcript barcode diversity is \textasciitilde{}105 so that each mRNA molecule within a cell becomes specifically labeled. After cell lysis, mRNAs hybridize to beads, which are pooled for reverse transcription, amplification, and sequencing. Because cDNAs from all polyadenylated transcripts of each cell are covalently archived on the bead surface, any selection of genes can be analyzed. The digital gene expression profile for each cell is reconstructed when barcoded transcripts are assigned to the cell of origin and counted.
RESULTS We applied CytoSeq to characterize complex heterogeneous samples in the human hematopoietic system by examining thousands of cells per experiment. In addition to surface proteins that are traditional cell type markers, we examined genes coding for cytokines, transcription factors, and intracellular proteins of various cellular functions that may not be readily accessible by flow cytometry. We demonstrated the ability to identify major subsets within human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We compared cellular heterogeneity in resting CD3+ T cells versus those stimulated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28, as well as resting CD8+ T cells versus those stimulated with CMV peptides, and identified the rare cells that were specific to the antigen. Highlighting the specificity of large-scale single-cell analysis compared with bulk sample measurements, we found that the up-regulation of a number of genes in the stimulated samples originated from only a few cells ({$<$}0.1\% of the population).
CONCLUSION The routine availability of gene expression cytometry will help transform our understanding of cellular diversity in complex biological systems and drive novel research and clinical applications. The massively parallel single-cell barcoding strategy described here may be applied to assay other biological molecules, including other RNAs, genomic DNA, and the genome and the transcriptome together. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6222/1258367/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Gene expression cytometry (CytoSeq). Massively parallel, stochastic barcoding of RNA content from single cells in a microwell bead array enables digital gene expression profiling of thousands of single cells simultaneously. Shown here is the principal component analysis for human PBMCs. Each point represents a single cell. Cells with correlated expression profiles are coded with similar colors.
We present a technically simple approach for gene expression cytometry combining next-generation sequencing with stochastic barcoding of single cells. A combinatorial library of beads bearing cell- and molecular-barcoding capture probes is used to uniquely label transcripts and reconstruct the digital gene expression profile of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment without the need for robotics or automation. We applied the technology to dissect the human hematopoietic system and to characterize heterogeneous response to in vitro stimulation. High sensitivity is demonstrated by detection of low-abundance transcripts and rare cells. Under current implementation, the technique can analyze a few thousand cells simultaneously and can readily scale to 10,000s or 100,000s of cells.
A simple approach allows gene expression analysis of a large collection of cells by stochastic barcoding of cells and sequencing.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONSingle-cell RNA sequencing has demonstrated that both stable cell types and transient cell states can be discovered and defined by transcriptomes. In situ transcriptomic methods can map both RNA quantity and position; however, it remains challenging to simultaneously satisfy key technological requirements such as efficiency, signal intensity, accuracy, scalability to large gene numbers, and applicability to three-dimensional (3D) volumes. Well-established single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches (such as MERFISH and seqFISH) have high detection efficiency but require long RNA species (more than 1000 nucelotides) and yield lower intensity than that of enzymatic amplification methods (tens versus thousands of fluorophores per RNA molecule). Other pioneering in situ sequencing methods (via padlock probes and fluorescent in situ sequencing) use enzymatic amplification, thus achieving high intensity but with room to improve on efficiency.
RATIONALEWe have developed, validated, and applied STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping). STARmap begins with labeling of cellular RNAs by pairs of DNA probes followed by enzymatic amplification so as to produce a DNA nanoball (amplicon), which eliminates background caused by mislabeling of single probes. Tissue can then be transformed into a 3D hydrogel DNA chip by anchoring DNA amplicons via an in situ–synthesized polymer network and removing proteins and lipids. This form of hydrogel-tissue chemistry replots amplicons onto an optically transparent hydrogel coordinate system; then, to identify and quantify RNA species-abundance manifested by DNA amplicons, the identity of each species is encoded as a five-base barcode and read out by means of an in situ sequencing method that decodes DNA sequence in multicolor fluorescence. Using a new two-base sequencing scheme (SEDAL), STARmap was found to simultaneously detect more than 1000 genes over six imaging cycles, in which sequencing errors in any cycle cause misdecoding and are effectively rejected.
RESULTSWe began by (i) detecting and quantifying a focused 160-gene set (including cell type markers and activity-regulated genes) simultaneously in mouse primary visual cortex; (ii) clustering resulting per-cell gene expression patterns into a dozen distinct inhibitory, excitatory, and non-neuronal cell types; and (iii) mapping the spatial distribution of all of these cell types across layers of cortex. For validation, per-cell-type gene expression was found to correlate well both with in situ hybridization results and with single-cell RNA sequencing, and widespread up-regulation of activity-regulated genes was observed in response to visual stimulation. We next applied STARmap to a higher cognitive area (the medial prefrontal cortex) and discovered a more complex distribution of cell types. Last, we extended STARmap to much larger numbers of genes and spatial scales; we measured 1020 genes simultaneously in sections—obtaining results concordant with the 160-gene set—and measured 28 genes across millimeter-scale volumes encompassing \textasciitilde{}30,000 cells, revealing 3D patterning principles that jointly characterize a broad and diverse spectrum of cell types.
CONCLUSIONSTARmap combines hydrogel-tissue chemistry and in situ DNA sequencing to achieve intact-tissue single-cell measurement of expression of more than a thousand genes. In the future, combining this intact-system gene expression measurement with complementary cellular-resolution methodologies (with which STARmap is designed to be compatible)—including in vivo activity recording, optogenetic causal tests, and anatomical connectivity in the same cells—will help bridge molecular, cellular, and circuit scales of neuroscience. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6400/eaat5691/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint STARmap for 3D transcriptome imaging and molecular cell typing.STARmap is an in situ RNA-sequencing technology that transforms intact tissue into a 3D hydrogel-tissue hybrid and measures spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes in situ. Error- and background-reduction mechanisms are implemented at multiple layers, enabling precise RNA quantification, spatially resolved cell typing, scalability to large gene numbers, and 3D mapping of tissue architecture.
Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional (3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult, limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues. We developed and applied a technology for 3D intact-tissue RNA sequencing, termed STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping), which integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry, targeted signal amplification, and in situ sequencing. The capabilities of STARmap were tested by mapping 160 to 1020 genes simultaneously in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution with high efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Moving to thick tissue blocks, we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter–scale volumes ({$>$}30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap.

Despite advances, current methods for single-cell sequencing are unable to resolve transcript location within the cell, so Lee et al. (p. 1360, published online 27 February) developed a method of fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) that works in vivo to show messenger RNA localization within cells. The method amplifies complementary DNA targets by rolling circle amplification, and then in situ cross-linking locks amplicons to produce ample, highly localized templates for three-dimensional sequencing. The technique was tested in fibroblasts to reveal the differences between individual cells during wound repair.
Understanding the spatial organization of gene expression with single-nucleotide resolution requires localizing the sequences of expressed RNA transcripts within a cell in situ. Here, we describe fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ), in which stably cross-linked complementary DNA (cDNA) amplicons are sequenced within a biological sample. Using 30-base reads from 8102 genes in situ, we examined RNA expression and localization in human primary fibroblasts with a simulated wound-healing assay. FISSEQ is compatible with tissue sections and whole-mount embryos and reduces the limitations of optical resolution and noisy signals on single-molecule detection. Our platform enables massively parallel detection of genetic elements, including gene transcripts and molecular barcodes, and can be used to investigate cellular phenotype, gene regulation, and environment in situ.

Mapping gene expression at the single-cell level within tissues remains a technical challenge.

Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. The authors used this method to dissect the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.

Spatial positions of cells in tissues strongly influence function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. These studies highlight how Slide-seq provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.

Analysis of the pattern of proteins or messengerRNAs (mRNAs) in histological tissue sections is a cornerstone in biomedical research and diagnostics. This typically involves the visualization of a few proteins or expressed genes at a time. We have devised a strategy, which we call “spatial transcriptomics,” that allows visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome with spatial resolution in individual tissue sections. By positioning histological sections on arrayed reverse transcription primers with unique positional barcodes, we demonstrate high-quality RNA-sequencing data with maintained two-dimensional positional information from the mouse brain and human breast cancer. Spatial transcriptomics provides quantitative gene expression data and visualization of the distribution of mRNAs within tissue sections and enables novel types of bioinformatics analyses, valuable in research and diagnostics.

In an effort to develop a robust assay to detect from urine low-abundant bladder cancer cells carrying well-documented mutations, we have tested the idea first on a set of mock templates, with wild type and known mutants mixed at defined ratios. We have measured the combined error rate for PCR and Illumina sequencing at each nucleotide position of three exons, and demonstrated the power of a UID in distinguishing and correcting errors. In addition, we have demonstrated that PCR sampling bias, rather than PCR errors, challenges the UID-deep sequencing method in faithfully detecting low frequency mutation.},

In combination with High Throughput Sequencing (HTS), PCR is widely used to quantify transcript abundance for RNA-seq and in the context of analysis of T and B cell receptor repertoires. In this study, we combine DNA barcoding with HTS to quantify PCR output from individual target molecules. We develop computational tools that simulate both the PCR branching process itself and the subsequent subsampling which typically occurs during HTS sequencing. We explore the influence of different types of heterogeneity on sequencing output and compare them to experimental results where the efficiency of amplification is measured by barcodes uniquely identifying each molecule of starting template. Our results demonstrate that the PCR process introduces substantial amplification heterogeneity, independent of primer sequence and bulk experimental conditions. This heterogeneity can be attributed both to inherited differences between different template DNA molecules and the inherent stochasticity of the PCR process. The results demonstrate that PCR heterogeneity arises even when reaction and substrate conditions are kept as constant as possible and therefore single molecule barcoding is essential in order to derive reproducible quantitative results from any protocol combining PCR with HTS.},

While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell types can appear as hybrid scRNA-seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic, mixed-species, genetic, and cell-hashing cell doublets from scRNA-seq datasets of varying cellular complexity with a high sensitivity relative to alternative approaches. Importantly, this algorithm prevents the prediction of valid mixed-lineage and transitional cell states as doublets by considering their unique gene expression. DoubletDecon has an easy-to-use graphical user interface and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its original sample, robustly identify cross-sample multiplets, and “super-load” commercial droplet-based systems for significant cost reduction. We validate our approach using a complementary genetic approach and demonstrate how hashing can generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.},

We found discrete “pulses” of gene activity that turn on and off at irregular intervals. Surprisingly, the length and height of these pulses were consistent throughout development. However, there was strong developmental variation in the proportion of cells recruited to the expressing pool. Cells were more likely to reexpress than to initiate new expression, indicating that we directly observe a transcriptional memory. In addition, we used a clustering algorithm to reveal synchronous transcription initiation in neighboring cells. This study represents the first direct visualization of transcriptional pulsing in eukaryotes. Discontinuity of transcription may allow greater flexibility in the gene-expression decisions of a cell.},

We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on ∼30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3′ cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.},

Analysis of the chemical composition and content of a single cell plays a vital role in ensuring precise investigations of cellular metabolism, and is a crucial aspect of lipidomic and proteomic studies. In addition, structural knowledge provides a better understanding of cell behavior as well as the cellular and subcellular mechanisms. However, single-cell analysis can be very challenging due to the very small size of each cell as well as the large variety and extremely low concentrations of substances found in individual cells. On account of its high sensitivity and selectivity, mass spectrometry holds great promise as an effective technique for single-cell analysis. Numerous mass spectrometric techniques have been developed to elucidate the molecular profiles at the cellular level, including electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-based mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In this review, the recent advances in single-cell analysis by mass spectrometry are summarized. The strategies of different ionization modes to achieve single-cell analysis are classified and discussed in detail.},

Modest observed correlations between global steady-state mRNA and protein measurements have been interpreted as evidence that mRNA levels determine roughly 40\% of the variation in protein levels, indicating dominant post-transcriptional effects. However, the techniques underlying these conclusions, such as correlation and regression, yield biased results when data are noisy, missing systematically, and collinear---properties of mRNA and protein measurements---which motivated us to revisit this subject. Noise-robust analyses of 24 studies of budding yeast reveal that mRNA levels explain more than 85\% of the variation in steady-state protein levels. Protein levels are not proportional to mRNA levels, but rise much more rapidly. Regulation of translation suffices to explain this nonlinear effect, revealing post-transcriptional amplification of, rather than competition with, transcriptional signals. These results substantially revise widely credited models of protein-level regulation, and introduce multiple noise-aware approaches essential for proper analysis of many biological phenomena.},

Such truncated cDNAs may contribute to 12\% of the expressed sequence tags in the current dbEST database. By using a synthetic transcript and real mRNA templates as models, we characterized the patterns of internal poly(A) priming by oligo(dT) primer. We further demonstrated that the internal poly(A) priming can be effectively diminished by replacing the oligo(dT) primer with a set of anchored oligo(dT) primers for reverse transcription. Our study indicates that cDNAs designed for genomewide gene identification should be synthesized by use of the anchored oligo(dT) primers, rather than the oligo(dT) primers, to diminish the generation of truncated cDNAs caused by internal poly(A) priming.},

  abstract = {RNA-Seq is widely used in biological and biomedical studies. Methods for the estimation of the transcript's abundance using RNA-Seq data have been intensively studied, many of which are based on the assumption that the short-reads of RNA-Seq are uniformly distributed along the transcripts. However, the short-reads are found to be nonuniformly distributed along the transcripts, which can greatly reduce the accuracies of these methods based on the uniform assumption. Several methods are developed to adjust the biases induced by this nonuniformity, utilizing the short-read's empirical distribution in transcript. As an alternative, we found that RNA degradation plays a major role in the formation of the short-read's nonuniform distribution and thus developed a new approach that quantifies the short-read's nonuniform distribution by precisely modeling RNA degradation. Our model of RNA degradation fits RNA-Seq data quite well, and based on this model, a new statistical method was further developed to estimate transcript expression level, as well as the RNA degradation rate, for individual genes and their isoforms. We showed that our method can improve the accuracy of transcript isoform expression estimation. The RNA degradation rate of individual transcript we estimated is consistent across samples and/or experiments/platforms. In addition, the RNA degradation rate from our model is independent of the RNA length, consistent with previous studies on RNA decay rate.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a cyclic process during which, within each epithelial area, various generations of germ cells undergo a series of developmental steps according to a fixed time schedule. The cycle of the seminiferous epithelium can be subdivided into stages. In the mouse, 12 such stages have been described that can be distinguished from one another by steps in spermatid development. The best way to recognize the stages in seminiferous tubule cross-sections is to use Bouin’s-fixed testes of normal mice and sections stained with the Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) technique and hematoxylin. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. Sometimes PAS staining cannot be used, such as when immunohistochemistry is carried out. Moreover, not all germ cell types may be present in some instances, as in young or mutant mice. We summarize here all stage-identifying criteria that can be used in the ideal situation as well as in hematoxylin-only stained sections and/or when germ cell types are missing.},

The cellular associations found in these stages and characteristics of the cells used to identify the stages have been well described. Here we present a binary decision key roadmap for identifying stages and present several examples of how staging tubules can be used to better assess the developmental profile of gene expression during spermatogenesis and defects in spermatogenesis arising in pathological conditions resulting from genetic mutations in mice. In particular, when one or more cells of a cellular association cannot be clearly identified or are missing, the cell types that should be present can be precisely identified by knowledge of the approximate or exact stage of the tubule cross section.},

It consists of segmentation of tubules in serial paraffin sections of the testis by marking the basement membrane with periodic acid–Schiff or a fluorescent anti-laminin antibody followed by 3D reconstruction of tubules with high-performance software. Using this method, we analyzed testes from mice at different ages and accurately elucidated the 3D structure of seminiferous tubules, including the number and length of tubules as well as the numbers of connections with the rete testis, branching points, and blind ends. We also developed a technique to identify the precise spermatogenic stage and cellular composition of the seminiferous epithelium. It consists of the combination of lectin histochemistry for acrosomes and immunohistochemistry for specific cell markers visualized with fluorescence. Using this method, we examined seminiferous tubules from normal mice and counted the number of each cell type at each stage, and thereby established a quantitative standard for the cellular composition of the seminiferous epithelium. We then investigated seminiferous epithelia from genetically modified infertile mice deficient in certain cell adhesion molecules and revealed characteristic abnormalities in the cellular composition. We also analyzed the distribution and direction of spermatogenic waves along the length of adult seminiferous tubules as well as the site of the first onset of spermatogenesis in postnatal seminiferous tubules. These methods will be useful for investigating the structure and function of seminiferous tubules in mice and humans under normal and pathological conditions.},

We first examined seminiferous tubules from normal mice and counted the number of each cell type at each stage of spermatogenesis. We then examined seminiferous tubules from genetically modified mice deficient (-/-) for one of the cell adhesion molecules, nectin-2 or nectin-3, and compared the number of each cell type at each stage of spermatogenesis with the corresponding value in normal mice. In both nectin-2-/- and nectin-3-/- mice, which are infertile despite the apparently normal morphology of the seminiferous epithelia, we measured a progressive loss in the later-step spermatids, with significantly lower numbers of step 11–16 spermatids in nectin-3-/- mice and step 15–16 spermatids in nectin-2-/- mice as compared with that in normal control mice.

The estimation of the duration of each cell association was approached by quantitating the total number of germinal cells and the total number of Sertoli cells in each cell association. A total of 30 cell associations in each were quantitated and the percentage of cells occurring for each was calculated. The time of the duration of 1 cycle of the germinal epithelium (16 days) was divided by the percentage of each cell association to arrive at the time in days for each. Results showed the following durations in days for each cell association: 1) 3.9 2) 2.7 3) 2.6 4) 2 5) 3.6 and 6) 1.1. Once the duration of each was established attention was turned to the individual cell involved. The spermatogonia A-dark A-pale and B type cells were found to exist 16 + 16 + and 9.5 days respectively. The spermatocytes preleptotene leptotene zygotene and pachytene were found to exist 2.6 5.6 1.1 and 15 days respectively.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Understanding the dynamics of spermatogenesis is central to clinical andrology or to probing environmental effects on human testes. This review considers what is known about renewal and proliferation of spermatogonia, how germ cells are organized in cellular associations constituting the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, relative frequencies of cellular associations, durations of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and spermatogenesis, and measurement of daily sperm production. Daily sperm production (DSP) per testis tends to decline with advancing age. Regardless of age, there is substantial loss of potential sperm from degeneration of spermatocytes, but not spermatids. DSP per gram testis parenchyma or DSP per testis cannot be predicted on the basis of testis size or age of a man. The review shows why our 1960s data base is neither robust nor precise and suggests how deficiencies might be rectified. New cellular associations should be defined, with none representing {$>$}15\% of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Then determine when Apale-spermatogonia become committed to proliferate or how many mitotic divisions occur thereafter. Restudy the duration of spermatogenesis because the accepted value might be in error by ∼6 days. Restudying human spermatogenesis will benefit clinicians, toxicologists, and epidemiologists probing testis function by direct evaluations or indirectly via evaluations of quantity and quality of sperm ejaculated. It also will benefit scientists interested in renewal and proliferation of spermatogonia, or a spermatogonium as a prototype stem cell.},

  abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a protein lattice that resembles railroad tracks and connects paired homologous chromosomes in most meiotic systems. The two side rails of the SC, known as lateral elements (LEs), are connected by proteins known as transverse filaments. The LEs are derived from the axial elements of the chromosomes and play important roles in chromosome condensation, pairing, transverse filament assembly, and prohibiting double-strand breaks (DSBs) from entering into recombination pathways that involve sister chromatids. The proteins that make up the transverse filaments of the SC also play a much earlier role in committing a subset of DSBs into a recombination pathway, which results in the production of reciprocal meiotic crossovers. Sites of crossover commitment can be observed as locations where the SC initiates and as immunostaining foci for a set of proteins required for the processing of DSBs to mature crossovers. In most (but not all) organisms it is the establishment of sites marking such crossover-committed DSBs that facilitates completion of synapsis (full-length extension of the SC). The function of the mature full-length SC may involve both the completion of meiotic recombination at the DNA level and the exchange of the axial elements of the two chromatids involved in the crossover. However, the demonstration that the sites of crossover formation are designated prior to SC formation, and the finding that these sites display interference, argues against a role of the mature SC in mediating the process of interference. Finally, in at least some organisms, modifications of the SC alone are sufficient to ensure meiotic chromosome segregation in the complete absence of meiotic recombination.},

It is shown that axial cores are formed in early meiotic prophase chromosomes and that the two axial cores of a set of homologous chromosomes participate in the formation of a synaptinemal complex. It is proposed that the transverse filaments of each axial core meet and interdigitate and so produce the transverse filaments of the complex. It is shown that the complex is axial to the pachytene bivalent and that the association of the complex with chromosomal material is terminated at the end of pachytene. The pairing affinity of the cores in homologous and non-homologous chromosome associations is discussed.

  abstract = {Using the Counce-Meyer spreading technique, in over 70 spermatocytes it was possible consistently to obtain whole, flattened nuclei containing complete sets of pachytene SCs. The SCs are visible in both the phase and electron microscopes. Each SC is morphologically intact, preferentially stained, and attached to the nuclear envelope by a dense, terminal plaque. It is thus possible to trace each SC for its entire length. Also, a structure representing the kinetochore is clearly visible in each autosomal SC. Karyotypes comparable to the somatic karyotype can be constructed by arranging SCs according to length and kinetochore position. The observed regularity of SC morphology implies structural stability sufficient to withstand the stresses imposed by the procedure.— A coarse network of closely packed nuclear annuli connecting SC attachment plaques often provides end-to-end associations and may tend to immobilize SCs during processing.— Three kinds of perturbation of SC structure are encountered. Twists in the SC frequently occur, but no regular pattern or correspondence with chiasma distribution is observed. SCs occasionally hook around each other without disruption, but in two instances the unpaired axis of the X apparently was interlocked within an autosomal SC. Stretching of the SC is infrequent; it is conspicuous when it occurs and is usually associated with other obvious distortions of the nucleus.— Distinctive morphologies of the X and Y chromosomes facilitate their identification in all preparations. — During zygotene, autosomal synapsis, i.e., the formation of SCs from the pairing of single axial elements, initiates at distal ends and terminates at the kinetochore region; neither initiation nor termination is synchronous among all autosomes.},

  abstract = {Meiotic chromosomes have been studied for many years, in part because of the fundamental life processes they represent, but also because meiosis involves the formation of homolog pairs, a feature which greatly facilitates the study of chromosome behavior. The complex events involved in homolog juxtaposition necessitate prolongation of prophase, thus permitting resolution of events that are temporally compressed in the mitotic cycle. Furthermore, once homologs are paired, the chromosomes are connected by a specific structure: the synaptonemal complex. Finally, interaction of homologs includes recombination at the DNA level, which is intimately linked to structural features of the chromosomes. In consequence, recombination-related events report on diverse aspects of chromosome morphogenesis, notably relationships between sisters, development of axial structure, and variations in chromatin status. The current article reviews recent information on these topics in an historical context. This juxtaposition has suggested new relationships between structure and function. Additional issues were addressed in a previous chapter (551).},

  abstract = {Recombination is a prominent feature of meiosis in which it plays an important role in increasing genetic diversity during inheritance. Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},

  abstract = {Whole mounted segments of seminiferous tubules from rat testes have been used to investigate the morphology and proliferative activity of the undifferentiated type A spermatogonial population. This has led to the formulation of a new model for spermatogonial stem cell renewal. Three groups of undifferentiated A spermatogonia were classified according to their topographical arrangements as isolated, paired, and aligned spermatogonia. It was proposed that the isolated (as well as a few paired) spermatogonia, which were always present throughout the seminiferous epithelium, are the functional stem cells and should therefore be designated as As. Through sporadic divisions, the As spermatogonia both maintain their own numbers and give rise to pairs of cells which are destined to eventually differentiate. The latter undergo several synchronous divisions in succession, thereby forming increasingly longer chains of aligned spermatogonia. The proliferation of these chains, primarily in stages I–V, leads to a gradual expansion in the size of the undifferentiated type A population. When the population attains its maximal size in stage V, mitotic activity among the aligned cells ceases, and all of these cells morphologically transform without further division into typical A1 spermatogonia. Subsequently, the cohort of A1 cells synchronously divides in stage IX to begin the long process of spermatogonial maturation. The isolated (and a few paired) cells, which do not undergo this transformation and remain quiescent during the stage IX peak of mitosis, form a residual stock of stem cells, that, during the course of another cycle, rebuild the population of aligned A spermatogonia. In this way, a continual supply of type A1 spermatogonia which will cyclically differentiate is insured.},

While various mRNA and protein localization studies have indirectly implicated changing retinoid levels along testis tubules, no quantitative evidence for these changes across the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium currently exists. This study utilized a unique mouse model of induced synchronous spermatogenesis, localization of the retinoid-signaling marker STRA8, and sensitive quantification of retinoic acid concentrations to determine whether there are fluctuations in retinoid levels at each of the individual stages of germ cell differentiation and maturation to sperm. These data show that processive pulses of retinoic acid are generated during spermatogonial differentiation and are the likely trigger for cyclic spermatogenesis and allow us, for the first time, to understand how the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is generated and maintained. In addition, this study represents the first direct quantification of a retinoid gradient controlling cellular differentiation in a postnatal tissue.},

  abstract = {Retinoic acid (vitamin A acid), the carboxylic acid corresponding to the primary alcohol retinol (vitamin A), has previously been thought to fulfil all the functions of vitamin A except in vision, since rats fed a diet deficient in retinol but supplemented with retinoic acid grow well, outwardly appearing healthy, yet become blind. This paper reports that female rats on such a diet had normal oestrous cycles and became pregnant when mated, but always resorbed the foetuses and no litters were born. The first abnormalities detected were necrosis and slight polymorph infiltration around the periphery of the placental disk about the sixteenth day of pregnancy. Supplementation with retinol as late as the tenth day resulted in the birth of a healthy litter. Retinoic acid therefore maintained the early but not the later stages of gestation. When very small amounts of retinol were given during pregnancy, dead or weak young were born; on higher supplements of the vitamin, litters were weaned successfully. By this means young rats were produced with negligible stores of retinol. Male rats fed retinoic acid but not retinol had small and often oedematous testes. The germinal epithelium sloughed off and in some tubules the lumen was obliterated, but in others the lumen remained, and in these some spermatocytes and spermatogonia were held tenaciously. The seminal vesicles were smaller than in controls given retinol. In rats born with negligible stores of retinol—see above—and maintained on retinoic acid, the testes remained infantile; spermatids were never formed. Feeding retinol restored spermatogenesis in degenerate testes and promoted the normal development of testes that had remained infantile; it also ensured the growth of the seminal vesicles. Retinoic acid did not therefore serve in reproduction, although it replaced the true vitamin in maintaining life, growth and general health. Besides the latter so-called systemic function, vitamin A must have a discrete and specific role in reproduction, viz. that performed by retinol but not by retinoic acid. From among the many previously reported features of disordered reproduction in vitamin A-deficient animals, it was possible to distinguish which had arisen from a failure of this specifically ‘reproductive’ role and which from a ‘systemic’ deficiency. The inactivity of retinoic acid in reproduction demonstrates that in rats vitamin A has not two, as previously thought, but three dissociable modes of action: (1) systemic; (2) in vision; and (3) in reproduction.},

Spermatogenesis is a highly orderly process that begins with the stem cell and terminates with the release of the mature spermatid into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule. In the mouse, the total duration of spermatogenesis, from the stem cell to the mature spermatid, is about 34.5 days and is subdivided into three phases: (1) the period of multiplication and maturation of spermatogonia or mitotic phase of spermatogenesis that lasts about eight days, (2) meiosis that lasts 13 days, and (3) spermiogenesis, from the early spermatid to the release of the spermatozoon into the lumen, which is about 13.5 days long. Biochemistry of spermatogenesis is one of the most promising areas of research in developmental biology and mammalian reproduction. The development of germ cell is a field, where different experimental approaches, cytology, ultrastructure, cytogenetics, genetics, biochemistry, immunology, endocrinology, can interact in a coordinated view of cell differentiation. The results described provide clear evidence for gene expression during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis in the mouse; the transcriptional activity during early spermiogenesis involves both polyadenylated RNA and ribosomal RNA.},

To identify BrdU-labeled spermatogenic cells, the spermatogenic stages must be determined by visualizing acrosomes and detecting cell type-specific marker molecules in the seminiferous tubules. However, the antibody reaction with BrdU routinely requires denaturation of the DNA, which is achieved by pretreating tissue sections with hydrochloric acid; however, this commonly interferes with further histochemical approaches. Therefore, we examined optimal methods for pretreating paraffin sections of the mouse testis to detect incorporated BrdU by an antibody and, at the same time, visualize acrosomes with peanut agglutinin (PNA) or detect several marker molecules with antibodies. We found that the use of heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIAR), which consisted of heating at 95C in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) for 15 min, was superior to the use of 2 N hydrochloric acid for 90 min at room temperature in terms of the quality of subsequent PNA-lectin histochemistry with double IHC for BrdU and an appropriate stage marker protein. With this method, we identified BrdU-labeled spermatogenic cells during mouse spermatogenesis as A1 spermatogonia through to preleptotene spermatocytes.},

Spermatogenesis is closely associated with pluripotency, because through this process highly specialized sperm cells are produced that contribute to the formation of totipotent zygotes. Nevertheless, it is unknown if NANOG plays a role in this process. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study, NANOG expression was examined in testes of various mammals, including mouse and human. Nanog mRNA and NANOG protein were detected by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Furthermore, eGFP expression was detected in the testis of a transgenic Nanog eGFP-reporter mouse. Surprisingly, although NANOG expression has previously been associated with undifferentiated cells with stem cell potential, expression in the testis was observed in pachytene spermatocytes and in the first steps of haploid germ cell maturation (spermiogenesis). Weak expression in type A spermatogonia was also observed. Conclusions The findings of the current study strongly suggest a conserved role for NANOG in meiotic and post-meiotic stages of male germ cell development.},

These findings strongly implicate Spo11 as the catalytic subunit of the meiotic DNA cleavage activity. This is the first identification of a biochemical function for any of the gene products involved in DSB formation. Spo11 defines a protein family with other members in fission yeast, nematodes, and archaebacteria. The S. pombe homolog, rec12p, is also known to be required for meiotic recombination.

We also found these motifs in proteins of the Hsp903 and MutL4 families. The A subunit has similarities with four proteins of unknown function. One of them, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spo115 protein, is required for the initiation of meiotic recombination. Mutagenesis, performed on SPO11, of the single tyrosine conserved between the five homologues shows that this amino acid is essential for Spo11 activity. By analogy with the mechanism of action of known type II topoisomerases, we suggest that Spo11 catalyses the formation of double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination in S. cerevisiae.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with protein covalently attached to 5′ strand termini are formed by Spo11 to initiate meiotic recombination,. The Spo11 protein must be removed for the DSB to be repaired, but the mechanism for removal has been unclear. We show here that meiotic DSBs in budding yeast are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage that releases Spo11 attached to an oligonucleotide with a free 3′-OH. Surprisingly, two discrete Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes were found in equal amounts, differing with respect to the length of the bound DNA. We propose that these forms arise from different spacings of strand cleavages flanking the DSB, with every DSB processed asymmetrically. Thus, the ends of a single DSB may be biochemically distinct at or before the initial processing step—significantly earlier than previously thought. SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes were identified in extracts of mouse testis, indicating that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Oligonucleotide-topoisomerase II complexes were also present in extracts of vegetative yeast, although not subject to the same genetic control as for generating Spo11-oligonucleotide complexes. Our findings suggest a general mechanism for repair of protein-linked DSBs.},

Cells use two major pathways for DSB repair: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The choice between these pathways depends on the phase of the cell cycle and the nature of the DSB ends. A critical determinant of repair pathway choice is the initiation of 5′-3′ resection of DNA ends, which commits cells to homology-dependent repair, and prevents repair by classical NHEJ. Here, we review the components of the end resection machinery, the role of end structure, and the cell-cycle phase on resection and the interplay of end processing with NHEJ.},

Both ATM and ATR are activated by DNA damage and DNA replication stress, but their DNA-damage specificities are distinct and their functions are not redundant. Furthermore, ATM and ATR often work together to signal DNA damage and regulate downstream processes. Here, we will discuss the recent findings and current models of how ATM and ATR sense DNA damage, how they are activated by DNA damage, and how they function in concert to regulate the DDR.},

Generation of ssDNA from a double-strand break (DSB) requires nucleolytic degradation of the 5′-terminated strands to generate 3′-ssDNA tails, a process referred to as 5′–3′ end resection. The RecBCD helicase–nuclease complex is the main end-processing machine in Gram-negative bacteria. Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 can play a direct role in end resection in archaea and eukaryota, respectively, by removing end-blocking lesions and act indirectly by recruiting the helicases and nucleases responsible for extensive resection. In eukaryotic cells, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical regulatory step to differentiate between homology-dependent and end-joining repair of DSBs.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination permits exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. The replication protein A (RPA) complex, the predominant ssDNA-binding complex, is required for nearly all aspects of DNA metabolism, but its role in mammalian meiotic recombination remains unknown due to the embryonic lethality of RPA mutant mice. RPA is a heterotrimer of RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3. We find that loss of RPA1, the largest subunit, leads to disappearance of RPA2 and RPA3, resulting in the absence of the RPA complex. Using an inducible germline-specific inactivation strategy, we find that loss of RPA completely abrogates loading of RAD51/DMC1 recombinases to programmed meiotic DNA double strand breaks, thus blocking strand invasion required for chromosome pairing and synapsis. Surprisingly, loading of MEIOB, SPATA22, and ATR to DNA double strand breaks is RPA-independent and does not promote RAD51/DMC1 recruitment in the absence of RPA. Finally, inactivation of RPA reduces crossover formation. Our results demonstrate that RPA plays two distinct roles in meiotic recombination: an essential role in recombinase recruitment at early stages and an important role in promoting crossover formation at later stages.},

Four generations of type A (called AI, AII, AIII, and AIV), one of intermediate, and one of type B spermatogonia occur in one cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. The average life span is about the same in all spermatogonia, i.e., about 27 to 30.5 hours. The average pre-DNA synthetic time, including the mitotic stages from metaphase through telophase and the portion of interphase preceding DNA synthesis, is also not very different, ranging between 7.5 and 10.5 hours. A remarkable difference exists, however, in the duration of DNA synthesis and of the post-DNA synthetic period. The average DNA synthetic time is very long and is highly variable in type B (14.5 hours), a little shorter and less variable in intermediate (12.5 hours) and AIV (13 hours) spermatogonia, and much shorter and very constant in AIII (8 hours), AII and AI (7 to 7.5 hours) spermatogonia. Conversely, the average post-DNA synthetic time, corresponding essentially to the duration of the prophase, is short and very constant in type B (4.5 hours), longer and variable in intermediate (6 hours) and AIV (8 hours) spermatogonia, and much longer and much more variable in AIII (11 hours), AII and AI (14 hours) spermatogonia. The premeiotic synthesis of DNA takes place in primary spermatocytes during the resting phase and terminates just before the visible onset of the meiotic prophase. Its average duration is 14 hours. No further synthesis of DNA takes place in later stages of spermatogenesis.},

To identify a large number of DSB sites and gain insight into the control of DSB formation at both the local and the whole chromosomal levels, we have determined at high resolution the distribution of meiotic DSBs along the 340 kb of chromosome III. We have found 76 DSB regions, mostly located in intergenic promoter-containing intervals. The frequency of DSBs varies at least 50-fold from one region to another. The global distribution of DSB regions along chromosome III is nonrandom, defining large (39–105 kb) chromosomal domains, both hot and cold. The distribution of these localized DSBs indicates that they are likely to initiate most crossovers along chromosome III, but some discrepancies remain to be explained.},

This hot spot activity persists when unlimited DNA synthesis is allowed. Crosses employing bio1-substituted phage strains exhibit recombinational hot spot activity located to the right of the middle of the chromosome and to the left of the cI gene.

In particular, it is uncertain to what extent crossovers are clustered into 'hot spots,6,7,8 that might influence LD patterns. As a first step to investigating the relationship between LD and recombination, we have analyzed a 216-kb segment of the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) already characterized for familial crossovers9. High-resolution LD analysis shows the existence of extended domains of strong association interrupted by patchwork areas of LD breakdown. Sperm typing shows that these areas correspond precisely to meiotic crossover hot spots. All six hot spots defined share a remarkably similar symmetrical morphology but vary considerably in intensity, and are not obviously associated with any primary DNA sequence determinants of hot-spot activity. These hot spots occur in clusters and together account for almost all crossovers in this region of the MHC. These data show that, within the MHC at least, crossovers are far from randomly distributed at the molecular level and that recombination hot spots can profoundly affect LD patterns.},

To identify a large number of DSB sites and gain insight into the control of DSB formation at both the local and the whole chromosomal levels, we have determined at high resolution the distribution of meiotic DSBs along the 340 kb of chromosome III. We have found 76 DSB regions, mostly located in intergenic promoter-containing intervals. The frequency of DSBs varies at least 50-fold from one region to another. The global distribution of DSB regions along chromosome III is nonrandom, defining large (39–105 kb) chromosomal domains, both hot and cold. The distribution of these localized DSBs indicates that they are likely to initiate most crossovers along chromosome III, but some discrepancies remain to be explained.},

  abstract = {Recombination plays a crucial role in meiosis, ensuring the proper segregation of chromosomes. Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow “hotspots.” To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60\% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.
High-density genotyping of individuals from 82 families shows unexpected variation in the number of meiotic crossovers and in the relative activity of recombination hotspots.

By combining data sets, we have collected recombination events from over 100,000 meioses and have constructed sex-specific genetic maps at a previously unachievable resolution. Here we show that, although a substantial fraction of the genome shows some degree of sexually dimorphic recombination, the vast majority of hotspots are shared between the sexes, with only a small number of putative sex-specific hotspots. Wavelet analysis indicates that most of the differences can be attributed to the fine scale, and that variation in rate between the sexes can mostly be explained by differences in hotspot magnitude, rather than location. Nonetheless, known recombination-associated genomic features, such as THE1B repeat elements, show systematic differences between the sexes., It is known that males have lower recombination rates than females over much of the genome but little is known about differences at a fine scale.

IntroductionThe dramatic events of meiotic recombination culminate in the exchange of genetic information between parental chromosomes and ensure the production of genetically distinct gametes. Recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and most DSBs occur at discrete hotspots defined by the DNA binding specificity of the PRDM9 protein. The tandem array of PRDM9 zinc fingers that binds DNA is highly polymorphic, and different variants have different DNA binding preferences. Subsequent to binding, PRDM9 is thought to modify the local chromatin environment and to recruit SPO11 for DSB formation. Meiotic DSBs are predominantly repaired through homologous recombination, giving rise to either genetic crossovers, where a reciprocal genetic exchange occurs between homologous chromosomes, or noncrossovers.

In meiotic cells, the formation of programmed meiotic DSBs facilitates the subsequent exchange of genetic material between parental homologous chromosomes. All current methods to study the sites of meiotic recombination rely on detection of these genetic exchanges. The DMC1 protein binds to DNA around meiotic DSBs, and in this work, we used testis biopsies from individual males to pull down the DNA bound by the DMC1 protein. We thus identified the sites of meiotic DSBs in five individual males. Analysis and comparison of the resultant PRDM9-specific, personal genome-wide maps offers insights into the mechanisms that initiate meiosis, genome evolution, crossover formation, human population structure, and predisposition to genomic disorders.
RationaleDespite recent progress in our understanding of recombination hotspot formation, the initiation of recombination remains poorly understood. Current approaches to study the early steps of meiotic recombination in humans primarily detect genetic crossovers, only one of the possible outcomes of DSB repair. Furthermore, these methods are limited by resolution, by sex and population averaging, or by an inability to extend the analysis genome-wide. To overcome these limitations, we built and analyzed high-resolution, individual-specific maps of meiotic DSBs in the human genome.
ResultsWe report the maps of meiotic DSBs in five males: two homozygous for the most common PRDM9 allele (PRDM9A) and three heterozygous for the PRDM9A allele and for the less frequent PRDM9B or PRDM9C alleles. We find that PRDM9A and PRDM9B define similar DSB hotspots, whereas the PRDM9C allele has a distinct specificity. A comparison of DSB hotspot maps with linkage disequilibrium (LD)–based estimates of recombination rates in the human population indicates that the LD map is a superimposition of PRDM9 allele-specific DSB maps and that the contribution of individual maps is proportional to the PRDM9 allele frequency in modern Africans. In individuals with identical PRDM9 alleles, over 5\% of DSB hotspots vary in strength, yet less than half of this variation could be explained by sequence variation at putative PRDM9 binding sites. We also find that PRDM9 heterozygosity affects hotspot strength. In human males, DSBs, like crossovers, occur more frequently at subtelomeric regions, and the crossover rate is directly proportional to our estimate of DSB frequency. This indicates that DSB initiation frequency is a major driver of the crossover rate in human males. We detect distinct signatures of GC-biased gene conversion and of recombination-coupled mutagenesis at DSB hotspots. In addition, DSB hotspots are enriched at the breakpoints of copy number variants that arise via homology-mediated mechanisms. Such variants may give rise to genomic disorders, and indeed, we find that meiotic DSBs defined by PRDM9A often coincide with disease-associated chromosomal breakpoints.
ConclusionsOur genome-wide recombination initiation maps in individual human males offer unprecedented resolution of recombination initiation sites defined by specific alleles of the PRDM9 protein. Our analysis indicates that DSB frequency is a primary determinant of crossover frequency, and that factors other than PRDM9 modulate the frequency of recombination initiation. We also find that meiotic DSB repair and subsequent recombination affect the genome sequence both locally and at the level of structural rearrangements. Taken together, these data provide a foundation for future studies of genetic recombination, meiosis, and genome stability.
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are introduced in meiosis to initiate recombination and generate crossovers, the reciprocal exchanges of genetic material between parental chromosomes. Here, we present high-resolution maps of meiotic DSBs in individual human genomes. Comparing DSB maps between individuals shows that along with DNA binding by PRDM9, additional factors may dictate the efficiency of DSB formation. We find evidence for both GC-biased gene conversion and mutagenesis around meiotic DSB hotspots, while frequent colocalization of DSB hotspots with chromosome rearrangement breakpoints implicates the aberrant repair of meiotic DSBs in genomic disorders. Furthermore, our data indicate that DSB frequency is a major determinant of crossover rate. These maps provide new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination and the impact of meiotic recombination on genome function.
Mapping recombination in individual human males
Sperm and eggs form from diploid cells that contain two copies of our genomic DNA. The haploid germ cells must undergo a special cell division, meiosis, which halves their DNA content. Meiosis involves a DNA recombination step between parental chromosomes. Recombination is initiated by a DNA double-strand break, which can exchange DNA between the chromosomes, a process that drives human genetic variation. Pratto et al. mapped meiotic recombination sites in individual human males (see the Perspective by de Massy). Recombination hotspots were influenced by variants of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase protein, PRDM9, as well as by other factors. The recombination sites also influence genome evolution and the incidence of genetic disease.

  abstract = {Going Ape Over Genetic Maps
Recombination is an important process in generating diversity and producing selectively advantageous genetic combinations. Thus, changes in recombination hotspots may influence speciation. To investigate the variation in recombination processes in humans and their closest existing relatives, Auton et al. (p. 193, published online 15 March) prepared a fine-scale genetic map of the Western chimpanzee and compared it with that of humans. While rates of recombination are comparable between humans and chimpanzees, the locations and genetic motifs associated with recombination differ between the species.
To study the evolution of recombination rates in apes, we developed methodology to construct a fine-scale genetic map from high-throughput sequence data from 10 Western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Compared to the human genetic map, broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.
Chimpanzees show similar genetic recombination rates as humans but differ in the genomic regions involved.

From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50\% of all recombination events take place in less than 10\% of the sequence.

Reciprocal crossover generates recombinant haplotypes but should not influence the frequencies of alleles in a population. We demonstrate crossover asymmetry at a recombination hot spot in the major histocompatibility complex1, whereby reciprocal exchanges in sperm map to different locations in the hot spot. We identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism at the center of the hot spot and show that, when heterozygous, it seems sufficient to cause this asymmetry, apparently by influencing the efficiency of highly localized crossover initiation. As a consequence, crossovers in heterozygotes are accompanied by biased gene conversion, most likely occurring by gap repair2, that can also affect nearby polymorphisms through repair of an extended gap. The result is substantial over-transmission of the recombination-suppressing allele and neighboring markers to crossover products. Computer simulations show that this meiotic drive, although weak at the population level, is sufficient to favor eventual fixation of the recombination-suppressing variant. These findings provide an explanation for the relatively uniform widths of human crossover hot spots and suggest that hot spots may be generally prone to extinction by meiotic drive3.},

For this purpose, we developed new linkage disequilibrium–based methods that thoroughly search for subsets of the data with unusually high or unusually low estimated values of the population-recombination parameter (4Nr, where N is the effective population size and r is the crossover rate between adjacent base pairs). By resequencing a 15-kb segment in a human population sample, we were able to narrow the recombinational hotspot to a segment {$<$}2 kb in length that coincides with the β-globin replication origin. In addition, we analyzed the orthologous region in samples of rhesus macaques and common chimpanzees. Whereas the analysis of the chimpanzee data is complicated by the sample structure, the macaque data imply that this region may not be a hotspot in that species. These results suggest a time scale for the evolution of hotspots in primates.

Moreover, the crossover asymmetry observed in a subset of these has led to the suggestion that hotspots may be short-lived on an evolutionary time scale. To test this possibility, we focused on a region known to contain a recombination hotspot in humans, TAP2, and asked whether chimpanzees, the closest living evolutionary relatives of humans, harbor a hotspot in a similar location. Specifically, we used a new statistical approach to estimate recombination rate variation from patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a sample of 24 western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). This method has been shown to produce reliable results on simulated data and on human data from the TAP2 region. Strikingly, however, it finds very little support for recombination rate variation at TAP2 in the western chimpanzee data. Moreover, simulations suggest that there should be stronger support if there were a hotspot similar to the one characterized in humans. Thus, it appears that the human TAP2 recombination hotspot is not shared by western chimpanzees. These findings demonstrate that fine-scale recombination rates can change between very closely related species and raise the possibility that rates differ among human populations, with important implications for linkage-disequilibrium based association studies.},

The canid family, including wolves and dogs, has undergone a series of disrupting mutations in this gene, rendering PRDM9 inactive. Given the importance of PRDM9, it is of great interest to learn how its absence in the dog genome affects patterns of recombination placement. We have used genotypes from domestic dog pedigrees to generate sex-specific genetic maps of recombination in this species. On a broad scale, we find that placement of recombination events in dogs is consistent with that in mice and apes, in that the majority of recombination occurs toward the telomeres in males, while female crossing over is more frequent and evenly spread along chromosomes. It has been previously suggested that dog recombination is more uniform in distribution than that of humans; however, we found that recombination in dogs is less uniform than in humans. We examined the distribution of recombination within the genome, and found that recombination is elevated immediately upstream of the transcription start site and around CpG islands, in agreement with previous studies, but that this effect is stronger in male dogs. We also found evidence for positive crossover interference influencing the spacing between recombination events in dogs, as has been observed in other species including humans and mice. Overall our data suggests that dogs have similar broad scale properties of recombination to humans, while fine scale recombination is similar to other species lacking PRDM9.},

Here we determined to what degree recombination rates are conserved among closely related species by estimating recombination rates from 14 Mb of linkage disequilibrium data in central chimpanzee and human populations. The results suggest that recombination hotspots are not conserved between the two species and that recombination rates in larger (50 kb) genomic regions are only weakly conserved. Therefore, the recombination landscape has changed markedly between the two species.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental process needed for the correct segregation of chromosomes during meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans, 80\% of crossovers are estimated to occur at specific areas of the genome called recombination hotspots. Recently, a protein called PRDM9 was identified as a major player in determining the location of genome-wide meiotic recombination hotspots in humans and mice. The origin of this protein seems to be ancient in evolutionary time, as reflected by its fairly conserved structure in lineages that diverged over 700 million years ago. Despite its important role, there are many animal groups in which Prdm9 is absent (e.g. birds, reptiles, amphibians, diptera) and it has been suggested to have disruptive mutations and thus to be a pseudogene in dogs. Because of the dog's history through domestication and artificial selection, we wanted to confirm the presence of a disrupted Prdm9 gene in dogs and determine whether this was exclusive of this species or whether it also occurred in its wild ancestor, the wolf, and in a close relative, the coyote. We sequenced the region in the dog genome that aligned to the last exon of the human Prdm9, containing the entire zinc finger domain, in 4 dogs, 17 wolves and 2 coyotes. Our results show that the three canid species possess mutations that likely make this gene non functional. Because these mutations are shared across the three species, they must have appeared prior to the split of the wolf and the coyote, millions of years ago, and are not related to domestication. In addition, our results suggest that in these three canid species recombination does not occur at hotspots or hotspot location is controlled through a mechanism yet to be determined.},

  abstract = {The identification of the H3K4 trimethylase, PRDM9, as the gene responsible for recombination hotspot localization has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9 and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes. By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG content of the dog genome could have occurred., Recombination in mammalian genomes tends to occur within highly localized regions known as recombination hotspots. These hotspots appear to be a ubiquitous feature of mammalian genomes, but tend to not be shared between closely related species despite high levels of DNA sequence similarity. This disparity has been largely explained by the discovery of PRDM9 as the gene responsible for localizing recombination hotspots via recognition and binding to specific DNA motifs. Variation within PRDM9 can lead to changes to the recognized motif, and hence changes to the location of recombination hotspots thought the genome. Multiple studies have shown that PRDM9 is under strong selective pressure, apparently leading to a rapid turnover of hotspot locations between species. However, uniquely amongst mammals, PRDM9 appears to be dysfunctional in dogs and other canids. In this paper, we investigate how the loss of PRDM9 has affected the fine-scale recombination landscape in dogs and contrast this with patterns seen in other species.},

To study the evolution and determinants of recombination in species lacking the gene that encodes PRDM9, we inferred fine-scale genetic maps from population resequencing data for two bird species: the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, and the long-tailed finch, Poephila acuticauda. We found that both species have recombination hotspots, which are enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in mice and apes, most hotspots are shared between the two species, and their conservation seems to extend over tens of millions of years. These observations suggest that in the absence of PRDM9, recombination targets functional features that both enable access to the genome and constrain its evolution.},

Using a single mouse and stickleback fish, we demonstrate how ReMIX faithfully recovers recombination hotspots and landscapes that have previously been built using hundreds of offspring.

The 5'and 3'-association clusters are 34.6 kilobases (kb) and 19.4 kb long, respectively, and are separated by 9.1 kb of DNA immediately 5' to the ,3-globin gene. For each of these three DNA regions, we have observed a relationship between nonrandom associations and physical distance between the polymorphisms. However, this relationship differed for each of these regions. On the assumption that the effective population size (Ne) is 5,000-50,000, we estimate the total recombination rate to be 0.0017\%-0.0002\% in the 5' cluster, 0.0931\%-0.0093\% in the 3' cluster, and 0.2912\%-0.0219\% in the 9.1-kb region between them. The e cluster thus shows nonuniformity in recombination. Moreover, the recombination rate in the 9. 1-kb DNA segment is 3-30 times greater than expected and is thus a hot spot for meiotic recombination.},

Three decades ago, we mapped a mammalian speciation gene, hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1), in the intersubspecific hybrids of house mouse. Here, we identify this gene as Prdm9, encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 trimethyltransferase. We rescued infertility in male hybrids with bacterial artificial chromosomes carrying Prdm9 from a strain with the “fertility” Hst1f allele. Sterile hybrids display down-regulated microrchidia 2B (Morc2b) and fail to compartmentalize γH2AX into the pachynema sex (XY) body. These defects, seen also in Prdm9-null mutants, are rescued by the Prdm9 transgene. Identification of a vertebrate hybrid sterility gene reveals a role for epigenetics in speciation and opens a window to a hybrid sterility gene network.
A gene responsible for sterility in the offspring of two mouse species, and therefore important in speciation, regulates gene expression via methylation in chromation.

The observed sterility is, by definition, hybrid sterility since both parental forms (i.e. wild and laboratory mice) are fully fertile, their male offspring displaying small testes with arrest of spermatogenesis at the stage of spermatogenesis or primary spermatocytes. Results of genetic analysis as well as the failure to detect any chromosomal rearrangements point to a genie rather than a chromosomal type of hybrid sterility.Fifty-three wild males were classified into three sets, after mating with C57BL/10 inbred females, according to the fertility of their male progeny (set I – only sterile sons; set II – only fertile sons; set III – both fertile and sterile sons). The wild males of set I, which yield only sterile male offspring with C57BL/10 females, sire sterile sons also with females of the following inbred strains: A/Ph, BALB/c, DBA/1, and AKR/J, whereas the same wild males produce fertile offspring with females of C3H/Di, CBA/J, P/J, I/St and F/St inbred strains.The described hybrid sterility seems to be under the control of several independently segregating genes, one of them (proposed symbol Hst-1) being localized on chromosome 17 (linkage group IX), 6 cM distally from dominant T (Brachyury). A chance to search for the mechanism of hybrid sterility is provided by the finding of two laboratory inbred strains, C57BL/10 and C3H/Di, differing with respect to the Hybrid sterility genetic system only at the Hst-1 gene.Hst-1 is closely linked but apparently not identical with the sterility factor of recessive t alleles of the T locus.},

On average, most people's genomes contain approximately 100 completely nonfunctional genes. These loss-of-function (LOF) mutations tend to be rare and/or occur only as a single copy within individuals. Narasimhan et al. investigated LOF in a Pakistani population with high levels of consanguinity. Examining LOF alleles that were identical by descent, they found, as expected, an absence of homozygote LOF for certain protein-coding genes. However, they also identified many homozygote LOF alleles with no apparent deleterious phenotype, including some that were expected to confer genetic disease. Indeed, one family had lost the recombination-associated gene PRDM9.
Science, this issue p. 474
Examining complete gene knockouts within a viable organism can inform on gene function. We sequenced the exomes of 3222 British adults of Pakistani heritage with high parental relatedness, discovering 1111 rare-variant homozygous genotypes with predicted loss of function (knockouts) in 781 genes. We observed 13.7\% fewer homozygous knockout genotypes than we expected, implying an average load of 1.6 recessive-lethal-equivalent loss-of-function (LOF) variants per adult. When genetic data were linked to the individuals’ lifelong health records, we observed no significant relationship between gene knockouts and clinical consultation or prescription rate. In this data set, we identified a healthy PRDM9-knockout mother and performed phased genome sequencing on her, her child, and control individuals. Our results show that meiotic recombination sites are localized away from PRDM9-dependent hotspots. Thus, natural LOF variants inform on essential genetic loci and demonstrate PRDM9 redundancy in humans.
The total loss of protein-coding genes, even those with the potential to confer genetic diseases, can be tolerated.

  abstract = {Crossovers play mechanical roles in meiotic chromosome segregation, generate genetic diversity by producing new allelic combinations, and facilitate evolution by decoupling linked alleles. In almost every species studied to date, crossover distributions are dramatically nonuniform, differing among sexes and across genomes, with spatial variation in crossover rates on scales from whole chromosomes to subkilobase hotspots. To understand the regulatory forces dictating these heterogeneous distributions a crucial first step is the fine-scale characterization of crossover distributions. Here we define the wild-type distribution of crossovers along a region of the C. elegans chromosome II at unprecedented resolution, using recombinant chromosomes of 243 hermaphrodites and 226 males. We find that well-characterized large-scale domains, with little fine-scale rate heterogeneity, dominate this region’s crossover landscape. Using the Gini coefficient as a summary statistic, we find that this region of the C. elegans genome has the least heterogeneous fine-scale crossover distribution yet observed among model organisms, and we show by simulation that the data are incompatible with a mammalian-type hotspot-rich landscape. The large-scale structural domains—the low-recombination center and the high-recombination arm—have a discrete boundary that we localize to a small region. This boundary coincides with the arm-center boundary defined both by nuclear-envelope attachment of DNA in somatic cells and GC content, consistent with proposals that these features of chromosome organization may be mechanical causes and evolutionary consequences of crossover recombination.},

  abstract = {Estimating fine-scale recombination maps of Drosophila from population genomic data is a challenging problem, in particular because of the high background recombination rate. In this paper, a new computational method is developed to address this challenge. Through an extensive simulation study, it is demonstrated that the method allows more accurate inference, and exhibits greater robustness to the effects of natural selection and noise, compared to a well-used previous method developed for studying fine-scale recombination rate variation in the human genome. As an application, a genome-wide analysis of genetic variation data is performed for two Drosophila melanogaster populations, one from North America (Raleigh, USA) and the other from Africa (Gikongoro, Rwanda). It is shown that fine-scale recombination rate variation is widespread throughout the D. melanogaster genome, across all chromosomes and in both populations. At the fine-scale, a conservative, systematic search for evidence of recombination hotspots suggests the existence of a handful of putative hotspots each with at least a tenfold increase in intensity over the background rate. A wavelet analysis is carried out to compare the estimated recombination maps in the two populations and to quantify the extent to which recombination rates are conserved. In general, similarity is observed at very broad scales, but substantial differences are seen at fine scales. The average recombination rate of the X chromosome appears to be higher than that of the autosomes in both populations, and this pattern is much more pronounced in the African population than the North American population. The correlation between various genomic features—including recombination rates, diversity, divergence, GC content, gene content, and sequence quality—is examined using the wavelet analysis, and it is shown that the most notable difference between D. melanogaster and humans is in the correlation between recombination and diversity., Recombination is a process by which chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis. It is important in evolution because it provides offspring with new combinations of genes, and so estimating the rate of recombination is of fundamental importance in various population genomic inference problems. In this paper, we develop a new statistical method to enable robust estimation of fine-scale recombination maps of Drosophila, a genus of common fruit flies, in which the background recombination rate is high and natural selection has been prevalent. We apply our method to produce fine-scale recombination maps for a North American population and an African population of D. melanogaster. For both populations, we find extensive fine-scale variation in recombination rate throughout the genome. We provide a quantitative characterization of the similarities and differences between the recombination maps of the two populations; our study reveals high correlation at broad scales and low correlation at fine scales, as has been documented among human populations. We also examine the correlation between various genomic features. Furthermore, using a conservative approach, we find a handful of putative recombination “hotspot” regions with solid statistical support for a local elevation of at least 10 times the background recombination rate.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination rate varies across the genome within and between individuals, populations, and species in virtually all taxa studied. In almost every species, this variation takes the form of discrete recombination hotspots, determined in some mammals by a protein called PRDM9. Hotspots and their determinants have a profound effect on the genomic landscape, and share certain features that extend across the tree of life. Drosophila, in contrast, are anomalous in their absence of hotspots, PRDM9, and other species-specific differences in the determination of recombination. To better understand the evolution of meiosis and general patterns of recombination across diverse taxa, we present a truly comprehensive portrait of recombination across time, combining recently published cross-based contemporary recombination estimates from each of two sister species with newly obtained linkage-disequilibrium-based historic estimates of recombination from both of these species. Using Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila miranda as a model system, we compare recombination rate between species at multiple scales, and we suggest that Drosophila replicate the pattern seen in human–chimpanzee in which recombination rate is conserved at broad scales. We also find evidence of a species-wide recombination modifier(s), resulting in both a present and historic genome-wide elevation of recombination rates in D. miranda, and identify broad scale effects on recombination from the presence of an inversion. Finally, we reveal an unprecedented view of the distribution of recombination in D. pseudoobscura, illustrating patterns of linked selection and where recombination is taking place. Overall, by combining these estimation approaches, we highlight key similarities and differences in recombination between Drosophila and other organisms.},

  abstract = {Recombination rate and linkage disequilibrium, the latter a function of population genomic processes, are the critical parameters for mapping by linkage and association, and their patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans are poorly understood. We performed high-density SNP genotyping on a large panel of recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) of C. elegans to characterize the landscape of recombination and, on a panel of wild strains, to characterize population genomic patterns. We confirmed that C. elegans autosomes exhibit discrete domains of nearly constant recombination rate, and we show, for the first time, that the pattern holds for the X chromosome as well. The terminal domains of each chromosome, spanning about 7\% of the genome, exhibit effectively no recombination. The RIAILs exhibit a 5.3-fold expansion of the genetic map. With median marker spacing of 61 kb, they are a powerful resource for mapping quantitative trait loci in C. elegans. Among 125 wild isolates, we identified only 41 distinct haplotypes. The patterns of genotypic similarity suggest that some presumed wild strains are laboratory contaminants. The Hawaiian strain, CB4856, exhibits genetic isolation from the remainder of the global population, whose members exhibit ample evidence of intercrossing and recombining. The population effective recombination rate, estimated from the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, is correlated with the estimated meiotic recombination rate, but its magnitude implies that the effective rate of outcrossing is extremely low, corroborating reports of selection against recombinant genotypes. Despite the low population, effective recombination rate and extensive linkage disequilibrium among chromosomes, which are techniques that account for background levels of genomic similarity, permit association mapping in wild C. elegans strains.},

Many linkage group termini also have clusters, though involving fewer loci. We examine the factors shaping the genetic map by analyzing the rate of recombination and gene density across the genome using the positions of cloned genes and random cDNA clones from the physical map. Each chromosome has a central gene-dense region (more diffuse on the X) with discrete boundaries, flanked by gene-poor regions. Only autosomes have reduced rates of recombination in these gene-dense regions. Cluster boundaries appear discrete also by recombination rate, and the boundaries defined by recombination rate and gene density mostly, but not always, coincide. Terminal clusters have greater gene densities than the adjoining arm but similar recombination rates. Thus, unlike in other species, most exchange in C. elegans occurs in gene-poor regions. The recombination rate across each cluster is constant and similar; and cluster size and gene number per chromosome are independent of the physical size of chromosomes. We propose a model of how this genome organization arose.},

They are typically 1–2 kb long and vary as much as a 1,000-fold or more in recombination activity. Although much is known about the molecular details of the recombination process itself, the factors determining the location and relative activity of hotspots are poorly understood. To further our understanding, we have collected and mapped the locations of 5,472 crossover events along mouse Chromosome 1 arising in 6,028 meioses of male and female reciprocal F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice. Crossovers were mapped to a minimum resolution of 225 kb, and those in the telomere-proximal 24.7 Mb were further mapped to resolve individual hotspots. Recombination rates were evolutionarily conserved on a regional scale, but not at the local level. There was a clear negative-exponential relationship between the relative activity and abundance of hotspot activity classes, such that a small number of the most active hotspots account for the majority of recombination. Females had 1.2× higher overall recombination than males did, although the sex ratio showed considerable regional variation. Locally, entirely sex-specific hotspots were rare. The initiation of recombination at the most active hotspot was regulated independently on the two parental chromatids, and analysis of reciprocal crosses indicated that parental imprinting has subtle effects on recombination rates. It appears that the regulation of mammalian recombination is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple factors reflecting species, sex, individual variation within species, and the properties of individual hotspots.},

Previous analysis of the recombination landscape in laboratory mice has revealed that the different subspecies have different suites of recombination hotspots. It is unknown, however, whether hotspots identified in laboratory strains reflect the hotspot diversity of natural populations or whether broad-scale variation in the rate of recombination is conserved between subspecies. In this study, we constructed fine-scale recombination rate maps for a natural population of the Eastern house mouse, Mus musculus castaneus. We performed simulations to assess the accuracy of recombination rate inference in the presence of phase errors, and we used a novel approach to quantify phase error. The spatial distribution of recombination events is strongly positively correlated between our castaneus map, and a map constructed using inbred lines derived predominantly from M. m. domesticus. Recombination hotspots in wild castaneus show little overlap, however, with the locations of double-strand breaks in wild-derived house mouse strains. Finally, we also find that genetic diversity in M. m. castaneus is positively correlated with the rate of recombination, consistent with pervasive natural selection operating in the genome. Our study suggests that recombination rate variation is conserved at broad scales between house mouse subspecies, but it is not strongly conserved at fine scales.},

The authors generated a comprehensive panel of high-quality maps of recombination hot spots across major mouse subspecies and their hybrids and provide novel insights into how the action of PRDM9 and the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots alter the genome and lead to incompatibilities in hybrids., Meiotic recombination is required for the segregation of homologous chromosomes and is essential for fertility. In most mammals, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are directed to a subset of genomic loci (hot spots) by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Rapid evolution of the DNA-binding specificity of PRDM9 and gradual erosion of PRDM9-binding sites by gene conversion will alter the recombination landscape over time. To better understand the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots and its consequences, we mapped DSB hot spots in four major subspecies of Mus musculus with different Prdm9 alleles and in their F1 hybrids. We found that hot spot erosion governs the preferential usage of some Prdm9 alleles over others in hybrid mice and increases sequence diversity specifically at hot spots that become active in the hybrids. As crossovers are disfavored at such hot spots, we propose that sequence divergence generated by hot spot turnover may create an impediment for recombination in hybrids, potentially leading to reduced fertility and, eventually, speciation.},

Although genetic and physical maps are colinear, there are well-characterized and sometimes dramatic heterogeneities in the average frequency of meiotic recombination events that occur along the physical extent of chromosomes. There also are documented differences in the recombination landscape between the two sexes. We have revisited high-resolution genetic map data from a large heterogeneous mouse population and have constructed a revised genetic map of the mouse genome, incorporating 10,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms using a set of 47 families comprising 3546 meioses. The revised map provides a different picture of recombination in the mouse from that reported previously. We have further integrated the genetic and physical maps of the genome and incorporated SSLP markers from other genetic maps into this new framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the revised genetic map improves QTL mapping, partially due to the resolution of previously undetected errors in marker ordering along the chromosome.},

Linkage disequilibrium is now accepted as the norm for closely linked loci, leading to powerful applications in the mapping of disease alleles and quantitative trait loci, in the detection of sites of selection in the human genome, in the application of genomic prediction of quantitative traits in animal and plant breeding, in the estimation of population size, and in the dating of population divergence.},

Meiotic exchanges are non-uniformly distributed across the genome of most studied organisms. This uneven distribution suggests that recombination is initiated by specific signals and/or regulations. Some of these signals were recently identified in humans and mice. However, it is unclear whether or not sequence signals are also involved in chromosomal recombination of insects.

Methodology
We analyzed recombination frequencies in the honeybee, in which genome sequencing provided a large amount of SNPs spread over the entire set of chromosomes. As the genome sequences were obtained from a pool of haploid males, which were the progeny of a single queen, an oocyte method (study of recombination on haploid males that develop from unfertilized eggs and hence are the direct reflect of female gametes haplotypes) was developed to detect recombined pairs of SNP sites. Sequences were further compared between recombinant and non-recombinant fragments to detect recombination-specific motifs.

Conclusions
Recombination events between adjacent SNP sites were detected at an average distance of 92 bp and revealed the existence of high rates of recombination events. This study also shows the presence of conversion without crossover (i. e. non-crossover) events, the number of which largely outnumbers that of crossover events. Furthermore the comparison of sequences that have undergone recombination with sequences that have not, led to the discovery of sequence motifs (CGCA, GCCGC, CCGCA), which may correspond to recombination signals.},

  doi = {10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r66},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The honey bee is a key model for social behavior and this feature led to the selection of the species for genome sequencing. A genetic map is a necessary companion to the sequence. In addition, because there was originally no physical map for the honey bee genome project, a meiotic map was the only resource for organizing the sequence assembly on the chromosomes.
RESULTS: We present the genetic (meiotic) map here and describe the main features that emerged from comparison with the sequence-based physical map. The genetic map of the honey bee is saturated and the chromosomes are oriented from the centromeric to the telomeric regions. The map is based on 2,008 markers and is about 40 Morgans (M) long, resulting in a marker density of one every 2.05 centiMorgans (cM). For the 186 megabases (Mb) of the genome mapped and assembled, this corresponds to a very high average recombination rate of 22.04 cM/Mb. Honey bee meiosis shows a relatively homogeneous recombination rate along and across chromosomes, as well as within and between individuals. Interference is higher than inferred from the Kosambi function of distance. In addition, numerous recombination hotspots are dispersed over the genome.
CONCLUSION: The very large genetic length of the honey bee genome, its small physical size and an almost complete genome sequence with a relatively low number of genes suggest a very promising future for association mapping in the honey bee, particularly as the existence of haploid males allows easy bulk segregant analysis.},

The exceptionally high recombination rate is distributed genome-wide, but varies by two orders of magnitude. Analysis of chromosome, sequence, and gene parameters with respect to recombination showed that local recombination rate is associated with distance to the telomere, GC content, and the number of simple repeats as described for low-recombining genomes. Recombination rate does not decrease with chromosome size. On average 5.7 recombination events per chromosome pair per meiosis are found in the honey bee genome. This contrasts with a wide range of taxa that have a uniform recombination frequency of about 1.6 per chromosome pair. The excess of recombination activity does not support a mechanistic role of recombination in stabilizing pairs of homologous chromosome during chromosome pairing. Recombination rate is associated with gene size, suggesting that introns are larger in regions of low recombination and may improve the efficacy of selection in these regions. Very few transposons and no retrotransposons are present in the high-recombining genome. We propose evolutionary explanations for the exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate.},

The unprecedented density of COs and the high-quality reference genomes of the two..., Many environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors are known to affect the frequency and positioning of meiotic crossovers (COs). Suppression of COs by large, cytologically visible inversions and translocations has long been recognized, but relatively little is known about how smaller structural variants (SVs) affect COs. To examine fine-scale determinants of the CO landscape, including SVs, we used a rapid, cost-effective method for high-throughput sequencing to generate a precise map of {$>$}17,000 COs between the Col-0 and Ler-0 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. COs were generally suppressed in regions with SVs, but this effect did not depend on the size of the variant region, and was only marginally affected by the variant type. CO suppression did not extend far beyond the SV borders and CO rates were slightly elevated in the flanking regions. Disease resistance gene clusters, which often exist as SVs, exhibited high CO rates at some loci, but there was a tendency toward depressed CO rates at loci where large structural differences exist between the two parents. Our high-density map also revealed in fine detail how CO positioning relates to genetic (DNA motifs) and epigenetic (chromatin structure) features of the genome. We conclude that suppression of COs occurs over a narrow region spanning large- and small-scale SVs, representing an influence on the CO landscape in addition to sequence and epigenetic variation along chromosomes.},

This map, which has a resolution several orders of magnitude greater than previous studies, identifies over 25000 recombination hotspots and gives new insights into the distribution and determination of recombination. Wavelet-based analysis demonstrates scale-specific influences of base composition, coding context and DNA repeats on recombination rates, though, in contrast with other species, no association with DNase I hypersensitivity. We have also identified specific DNA motifs that are strongly associated with recombination hotspots and whose activity is influenced by local context. Comparative analysis of recombination rates in humans and chimpanzees demonstrates very high rates of evolution of the fine-scale structure of the recombination landscape. In the light of these observations, we suggest possible resolutions of the hotspot paradox.},

Theoretically, hotspots — favored sites of recombination initiation — either evolve rapidly toward extinction or are conserved, especially if they are chromosomal features under selective constraint, such as promoters. We tested these theories by comparing genome-wide recombination initiation maps from widely divergent Saccharomyces species. We find that hotspots frequently overlap with promoters in the species tested and, consequently, hotspot positions are well conserved. Remarkably, the relative strength of individual hotspots is also highly conserved, as are larger-scale features of the distribution of recombination initiation. This stability, not predicted by prior models, suggests that the particular shape of the yeast recombination landscape is adaptive, and helps in understanding evolutionary dynamics of recombination in other species.},

In addition to disease and trait genetics, EHRs proved a valuable resource for analyzing pharmacogenetic traits and developing reverse genetics approaches such as phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs). PheWASs are designed to survey which of many phenotypes may be associated with a given genetic variant. PheWAS methods have been validated through replication of hundreds of known genotype-phenotype associations, and their use has differentiated between true pleiotropy and clinical comorbidity, added context to genetic discoveries, and helped define disease subtypes, and may also help repurpose medications. PheWAS methods have also proven to be useful with research-collected data. Future efforts that integrate broad, robust collection of phenotype data (e.g., EHR data) with purpose-collected research data in combination with a greater understanding of EHR data will create a rich resource for increasingly more efficient and detailed genome-phenome analysis to usher in new discoveries in precision medicine.},

The PheWAS paradigm takes advantage of a curated medical phenome, often derived from electronic health records, to search for associations between ‘input functions’ and phenotypes in an unbiased fashion. The most commonly studied input function to date has been single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but other inputs, such as sets of SNPs or a disease or drug exposure, are now being explored to probe the genetic and phenotypic architecture of human traits.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Human genetics seeks a way to improve human health on a global scale. Expectations are running high for polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to be translated into clinical practice to predict an inborn susceptibility to health risks. While risk stratification based on PRS is one way to promote population health, a strategy to utilize genetics to prioritize modifiable risk factors and biomarkers driving heath outcome is also warranted. To this end, here we utilized PRSs to comprehensively investigate the association of the genetic susceptibility to complex traits with human lifespan in collaboration with three worldwide biobanks (ntotal = 675,898). First, we conducted genome-wide association studies for 45 quantitative clinical phenotypes, constructed the individual PRSs, and associated them with the age at death of 179,066 participants in BioBank Japan. The PRSs revealed that the genetic susceptibility of high systolic blood pressure (sBP) was strongly associated with a shorter lifespan (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.03, P = 1.4×10\textsuperscript{-7}). Next, we sought to replicate these associations in individuals of European ancestry in UK Biobank (n = 361,194) and the FinnGen cohort (n = 135,638). Among the investigated traits, the individuals with higher blood pressure-related PRSs were trans-ethnically associated with a shorter lifespan (HR = 1.03, P\textsubscript{meta} = 3.9×10\textsuperscript{-13} for sBP) and parental lifespan (HR = 1.06, P\textsubscript{UKBB} = 2.0×10\textsuperscript{-86} for sBP). Further, our trans-biobank study identified additional complex traits associated with lifespan (e.g., obesity, height, serum lipids, and platelet counts). Of them, obesity-related traits showed strikingly heterogeneous effects on lifespan between Japanese and European populations (P\textsubscript{heterogeneity} = 9.5×10\textsuperscript{-8} for body mass index). Through trans-ethnic biobank collaboration, we elucidated the novel value of the PRS study in genetics-driven prioritization of risk factors and biomarkers which can be medically intervened to improve population health.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Crossover recombination is essential for generating genetic diversity and promoting accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. The process of crossover recombination is tightly regulated and is initiated by the formation of programmed meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The number of DSBs is around ten-fold higher than the number of crossovers in most species, since only a limited number of DSBs is repaired as crossovers during meiosis. Moreover, crossovers are not randomly distributed. Most crossovers are located on chromosomal arm regions and both centromeres and telomeres are usually devoid of crossovers. Either loss or mislocalization of crossovers frequently results in chromosome nondisjunction and subsequent aneuploidy, leading to infertility, miscarriages and birth defects such as Down syndrome. Here, we will review aspects of crossover regulation observed in most species and then focus on crossover regulation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which both the frequency and distribution of crossovers are tightly controlled. In this system, only a single crossover is formed, usually at an off-centered position, between each pair of homologous chromosomes. We have identified C. elegans mutants with deregulated crossover distribution and we are analyzing crossover control by using an inducible single DSB system with which a single crossover can be produced at specific genomic positions. These combined studies are revealing novel insights into how crossover position is linked to accurate chromosome segregation.},

  abstract = {Although recombination is essential to the successful completion of human meiosis, it remains unclear how tightly the process is regulated and over what scale. To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on human recombination, we examined crossover patterns in transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring, using dense genotyping data collected in a large set of pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring in proportion to physical length. The requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its correct segregation. We also found a set of double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover interference. These findings point to multiple mechanisms that shape the distribution of crossovers, influencing proper disjunction in humans.},

This review highlights the features of meiotic recombination that distinguish it from recombinational repair in somatic cells, and how the molecular processes of meiotic recombination are embedded and interdependent with the chromosome structures that characterize meiotic prophase. A more in-depth review presents our understanding of how crossover and noncrossover pathways of meiotic recombination are differentiated and regulated.

However, ≈25\% of these intermediates fail to mature to final CO products. This effect explains the high baseline of aneuploidy and is predicted to synergize with age-dependent cohesion loss to explain the maternal age effect.

Meiotic crossovers are essential for ensuring correct chromosome segregation as well as for creating new combinations of alleles for natural selection to take place. During meiosis, excess meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated; a subset of these breaks are repaired to form crossovers, whereas the remainder are repaired as non-crossovers. What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale – in addition to current models for the generation of interference – is also included. This Commentary aims to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the factors that promote or prevent meiotic crossing over.},

DSBs are catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved SPO11 protein, assisted by several other factors. Some of them are absolutely required, whereas others are needed only for full levels of DSB formation and may participate in the regulation of DSB timing and frequency as well as the coordination between DSB formation and repair. The sites where DSBs occur are not randomly distributed in the genome, and remarkably distinct strategies have emerged to control their localization in different species. Here, I review the recent advances in the components required for DSB formation and localization in the various model organisms in which these studies have been performed.},

One key role of CO is to connect homologs before metaphase I and thus to ensure the proper reductional segregation. This role implies an accurate regulation of CO frequency with the establishment of at least one CO per chromosome arm. Current major challenges are to understand how CO and NCO formation are regulated and what is the role of NCO. We present here the current knowledge about CO and NCO and their regulation in mammals. CO density varies widely along chromosomes and their distribution is not random as they are subject to positive interference. As documented in the mouse and human, a significant excess of DSB are generated relative to the number of CO. In fact, evidence has been obtained for the formation of NCO products, for regulation of the choice of DSB repair towards CO or NCO and for a CO specific pathway. We discuss the roles of Msh4, Msh5 and Sycp1 which affect DSB repair and probably not only the CO pathway. We suggest that, in mammals, the regulation of NCO differs from that described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

The only phenotype of mouse PRDM9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes sterility in both sexes. The PRDM9 gene encodes a protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase activity, a KRAB domain, and a DNA-binding domain consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism and interspecies evolutionary changes in the PRDM9 gene. The ZF domains of PRDM9 are evolving very rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive selection in primates. Positively selected amino acids are predominantly those known to make nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers. These results suggest that PRDM9 is subject to recurrent selection to change DNA-binding specificity. The human PRDM9 protein is highly polymorphic in its ZF domains and nearly all polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact residues that are subject to positive selection. ZF domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized within species, indicating that interfinger recombination contributes to their evolution. PRDM9 has previously been assumed to be a transcription factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a role that is inconsistent with its molecular evolution. We suggest instead that PRDM9 is involved in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and that rapidly evolving centromeric DNA drives changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domains.},

  abstract = {Studies of meiotic recombination have revealed an evolutionary paradox. Molecular and genetic analysis has shown that crossing over initiates at specific sites called hotspots, by a recombinational-repair mechanism in which the initiating hotspot is replaced by a copy of its homolog. We have used computer simulations of large populations to show that this mechanism causes active hotspot alleles to be rapidly replaced by inactive alleles, which arise by rare mutation and increase by recombination-associated conversion. Additional simulations solidified the paradox by showing that the known benefits of recombination appear inadequate to maintain its mechanism. Neither the benefits of accurate segregation nor those of recombining flanking genes were sufficient to preserve active alleles in the face of conversion. A partial resolution to this paradox was obtained by introducing into the model an additional, nonmeiotic function for the sites that initiate recombination, consistent with the observed association of hotspots with functional sites in chromatin. Provided selection for this function was sufficiently strong, active hotspots were able to persist in spite of frequent conversion to inactive alleles. However, this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, it is unlikely to apply to obligately sexual species, because observed crossover frequencies imply maintenance of many hotspots per genome, and the viability selection needed to preserve these would drive the species to extinction. Second, it fails to explain why such a genetically costly mechanism of recombination has been maintained over evolutionary time. Thus the paradox persists and is likely to be resolved only by significant changes to the commonly accepted mechanism of crossing over.},

We investigate the implications of such a bias on human hotspots and their evolution. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion bias is a sufficiently strong force to produce the observed lack of sharing of intense hotspots between species, although sharing may be much more common for weaker hotspots. We investigate models of how hotspots arise, and find that only models in which hotspot alleles do not initially experience drive are consistent with observations of rather hot hotspots in the human genome. Mutations acting against drive cannot successfully introduce such hotspots into the population, even if there is direct selection for higher recombination rates, such as to ensure correct segregation during meiosis. We explore the impact of hotspot alleles on patterns of haplotype variation, and show that such alleles mask their presence in population genetic data, making them difficult to detect.},

Recombination is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) that requires the intervention of the molecular repair mechanism. The DSB repair mechanism may result in the exchange of homologous chromosomes (crossover) and the conversion of the allelic sequence that breaks into the one that does not break (biased gene conversion). Biased gene conversion results in a transmission advantage for the allele that does not break, thus preventing recombination and rendering recombination hotspots transient. How is it possible that recombination hotspots persist over evolutionary time (maintaining the average chromosomal crossover rate) when they are self-destructive? This fundamental question is known as the recombination hotspot paradox and has attracted much attention in recent years. Yet, that attention has not translated into a fully satisfactory answer. No existing model adequately explains all aspects of the recombination hotspot paradox. Here, we formulate an intragenomic conflict model resulting in Red Queen dynamics that fully accounts for all empirical observations regarding the molecular mechanisms of recombination hotspots, the nonrandom targeting of the recombination machinery to hotspots and the evolutionary dynamics of hotspot turnover.},

  abstract = {Posttranslational modification of histones has emerged as a key regulatory signal in eukaryotic gene expression. Recent genetic and biochemical studies link H3-lysine 9 (H3-K9) methylation to HP1-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. However, the mechanisms that target and coordinate these activities to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we report that the KAP-1 corepressor for the KRAB-ZFP superfamily of transcriptional silencers binds to SETDB1, a novel SET domain protein with histone H3-K9-specific methyltransferase activity. Although acetylation and phosphorylation of the H3 N-terminal tail profoundly affect the efficiency of H3-K9 methylation by SETDB1, we found that methylation of H3-K4 does not affect SETDB1-mediated methylation of H3-K9. In vitro methylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 by SETDB1 is sufficient to enhance the binding of HP1 proteins, which requires both an intact chromodomain and chromoshadow domain. Indirect immunofluoresence staining of interphase nuclei localized SETDB1 predominantly in euchromatic regions that overlap with HP1 staining in nonpericentromeric regions of chromatin. Moreover, KAP-1, SETDB1, H3-MeK9, and HP1 are enriched at promoter sequences of a euchromatic gene silenced by the KRAB–KAP-1 repression system. Thus, KAP-1 is a molecular scaffold that is targeted by KRAB-ZFPs to specific loci and coordinates both histone methylation and the deposition of HP1 proteins to silence gene expression.},

Several studies using different approaches have dramatically advanced our understanding of recombination hotspot regulation. Population genetic data have been used to map and quantify hotspots in the human genome. Genetic variation in recombination rates and hotspots usage have been explored in human pedigrees, mouse intercrosses, and by sperm typing. These studies pointed to the central role of the PRDM9 gene in hotspot modulation. In this study, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole-genome resequencing and genotyping studies of mouse inbred strains to estimate recombination rates across the mouse genome and identified 47,068 historical hotspots—an average of over 2477 per chromosome. We show by simulation that inbred mouse strains can be used to identify positions of historical hotspots. Recombination hotspots were found to be enriched for the predicted binding sequences for different alleles of the PRDM9 protein. Recombination rates were on average lower near transcription start sites (TSS). Comparing the inferred historical recombination hotspots with the recent genome-wide mapping of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mouse sperm revealed a significant overlap, especially toward the telomeres. Our results suggest that inbred strains can be used to characterize and study the dynamics of historical recombination hotspots. They also strengthen previous findings on mouse recombination hotspots, and specifically the impact of sequence variants in Prdm9.},

To study variation in meiotic outcomes within and across individuals, we developed a way to sequence many individual sperm genomes at once. We used this method to sequence the genomes of 31,228 gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122 crossovers, 787 aneuploid chromosomes, and unexpected genomic anomalies. Different sperm donors varied four-fold in the frequency of aneuploid sperm, and aneuploid chromosomes gained in meiosis I had 36\% fewer crossovers than corresponding non-aneuploid chromosomes. Diverse recombination phenotypes were surprisingly coordinated: donors with high average crossover rates also made a larger fraction of their crossovers in centromere-proximal regions and placed their crossovers closer together. These same relationships were also evident in the variation among individual gametes from the same donor: sperm with more crossovers tended to have made crossovers closer together and in centromere-proximal regions. Variation in the physical compaction of chromosomes could help explain this coordination of meiotic variation across chromosomes, gametes, and individuals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These chromosome breaks occur during meiotic prophase and are essential for meiotic recombination as well as the subsequent segregation of homologous chromosomes. However, their formation and repair must be carefully monitored and choreographed with nuclear dynamics and the cell division program to avoid the creation of aberrant chromosomes and defective gametes. It is becoming increasingly clear that an intricate checkpoint-signaling network related to the canonical DNA damage response is deeply interwoven with the meiotic program and preserves order during meiotic prophase. This meiotic checkpoint network (MCN) creates a wide range of dependent relationships controlling chromosome movement, chromosome pairing, chromatin structure, and double-strand break (DSB) repair. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the MCN. We discuss commonalities and differences in different experimental systems, with a particular emphasis on the emerging design principles that control and limit cross talk between signals to ultimately ensure the faithful inheritance of chromosomes by the next generation.},

To correlate cytological events with meiotic progression in testis and to determine which meiotic events are normally completed by Stage IV, we induced spermatogenic arrest by placing mice on a vitamin A deficient diet. Subsequent injection of retinoic acid and a return to a normal diet resulted in resumption of spermatogenesis with all spermatocytes proceeding through meiosis in a highly synchronous cohort. Between Days 11 and 16 post-injection we prepared one testis for immunocytological and the other for histological evaluation, then used antibodies to SCP3 and either RPA, or MLH1 to follow quantitative changes in synapsis and recombination. RPA was found at sites along the synaptonemal complex as soon as homologs synapsed, and most, but not all, RPA disappeared by Stage IV. MLH1 foci appeared between Stage II and IV and remained through Stage VII, the end point of the study. The data suggest that the earliest the mid-pachytene checkpoint can be activated is Epithelial Stage IV, but that activities monitored by the checkpoint may not be completed by this time.},

Entering meiosis, strong cohesin-dependent grid-like Hi-C interaction patterns emerge, reminiscent of mammalian interphase organisation, but with distinct regulation. Meiotic patterns agree with simulations of loop extrusion limited by barriers, yet are patterned by convergent transcription rather than binding of the mammalian interphase factor, CTCF, which is absent in S. cerevisiae - thereby both challenging and extending current paradigms of local chromosome organisation. While grid-like interactions emerge independently of meiotic chromosome synapsis, synapsis itself generates additional compaction that matures differentially according to telomere proximity and chromosome size.

If males and females supply equal amounts of hereditary material, then the latter must double each time an embryo is conceived.

A compensatory mechanism for diluting the hereditary material must exist, one that ensures that if each parent contributes one half, each grandparent contributes a quarter, and each great grandparent merely an eighth.

The acrosome is a special kind of organelle with a cap-like structure that covers the anterior portion of the head of a the spermatozoon. The acrosome is derived from the Golgi apparatus and contains digestive enzymes. With the progress of our understanding underlying of acrosome biogenesis, a number of models have been proposed to address the origin of the acrosome. The acrosome has been regarded as a lysosome-related organelle, and it has been proposed to have originated from the lysosome or the autolysosome. Our review will provide a brief historical overview and highlight recent findings on acrosome biogenesis in mammals.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, acrosomal exocytosis (also called the “acrosome reaction”) has been recognized as playing an essential role in fertilization. Secretion of this granule is an absolute requirement for physiological fertilization. In recent years, the study of mammalian acrosomal exocytosis has yielded some major advances that challenge the long-held, general paradigms in the field. Principally, the idea that sperm must be acrosome-intact to bind to the zona pellucida of unfertilized eggs, based largely on in vitro fertilization studies of mouse oocytes denuded of the cumulus oophorus, has been overturned by experiments using state-of-the-art imaging of cumulus-intact oocytes and fertilization experiments where eggs were reinseminated by acrosome-reacted sperm recovered from the perivitelline space of zygotes. From a molecular point of view, acrosome exocytosis is a synchronized and tightly regulated process mediated by molecular mechanisms that are homologous to those reported in neuroendocrinal cell secretions. The authors provide a broader perspective, focusing on a limited number of important topics that are essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing this step in the fertilization process. They also discuss molecular aspects such as the signaling pathways leading to exocytosis, including the participation of ion channels, lipids, the fusion machinery proteins and the actin cytoskeleton as well as cellular aspects such as the site of acrosomal exocytosis and the use of gene-manipulated animals to study this process.},

Taking advantage of recent clinical development advances and rapid growth in GWAS datasets, we extend the original work using updated data, test whether genetic evidence predicts future successes and introduce statistical models adjusting for target and indication-level properties. Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III. When causal genes are clear (Mendelian traits and GWAS associations linked to coding variants), we find the use of human genetic evidence increases approval by greater than two-fold, and, for Mendelian associations, the positive association holds prospectively. Our findings suggest investments into genomics and genetics are likely to be beneficial to companies deploying this strategy.},

  abstract = {In the middle piece of mouse sperm tail, the idea of the mitochondria wrapping in a sinistral (left-handed) double helical structure was generally accepted. In the existing model, mitochondria aligned in four longitudinal rows (stage 1) and twisted dextrally (right-handed) (stage 2) and began to stagger, where opposing rows of mitochondria contacted each other to form a sinistral double helix (stage 3), finally, the end-on touching mitochondria further elongated to their mature length (stage 4). However, in this model, mitochondria need to shift a long distance and reposition themselves. Since no gaps have been found in mitochondrial sheath, repositioning of most mitochondria along the middle piece is unlikely to happen. Therefore, we reapproached the questions through three-dimensional rendering to provide a new model for mitochondrial sheath formation. In our proposed model, four dextrally arranged spherical mitochondrial arrays were considered stage 1 (resembles stage 2 of the old model). In stage 2 (resembles stage 3 of the old model), a critical difference was found that pairs of mitochondria from the opposing arrays formed ring-like structures instead of a sinistral double helix. In stage 3, which was not observed in the old model, mitochondria staggered in a specific pattern to form the sinistral double helix. In stage 4, mitochondria elongated from crescent-shaped to rod-shaped structures. The new model proposed here would allow each mitochondrion to stay at where they attached first and elongate laterally from two directions to reach their final double helical structure without unreasonable great distance shift along the outer dense fibers.

The precursor material extends radially from the centrioles and polymerizes around them to form the connecting piece. This is not composed of “segments” or “lamellae” as usually described but is a cross-striated fibrous protein with a major period of 665 A and a complex pattern of intraperiod bands. It is considered to be homologous with the striated rootlets of cilia. During differentiation of this region, the proximal centriole develops at one end, a cylindrical prolongation which is similar in its structure but not identical with the centriole proper. This centriolar adjunct is a transient structure. The proximal centriole persists in the mature spermatozoon, but the distal centriole disintegrates during formation of the connecting-piece. The outer dense fibers of the flagellum and the cross-striated columns of the connecting piece are distinct components which arise separately and secondarily become continuous. The dense fibers originate as ridge-like radial outgrowths from the wall of the corresponding doublets in the axonemal complex. As they enlarge they separate from the doublets throughout most of their length but they remain continuous with them at their distal ends.},

  abstract = {Each human spermatozoon contains two remodeled centrioles that it contributes to the zygote. There, they reconstitute a centrosome that assembles the sperm aster and participates in pronuclei migration and cleavage. Thus, centriole abnormalities may be a cause of male factor infertility and failure to carry pregnancy to term. However, the precise mechanisms by which sperm centrioles contribute to embryonic development in humans is still unclear - making the search for a link between centriole abnormalities and impaired male fecundity particularly difficult. Most previous investigations into the role of centrioles during fertilization have been completed in animal models, which provide only limited information that can be translated to humans. Here, we review studies that examine the role of the sperm centrioles in the early embryo, with particular emphasis on humans. Available literature includes case studies and case-control studies, with a few retrospective and no prospective studies reported. This literature has provided some insight into morphological characteristics of sperm centrioles in the zygote and has allowed identification of some centriole abnormalities in rare cases. Many of these studies suggest centriole involvement based on phenotypes of the embryo with only indirect evidence for centriole abnormality. Overall, these studies suggest that centriole abnormalities are present in some cases of sperm with asthenoteratozoospermia and unexplained infertility. Yet, most previously published studies have been restricted by use of laborious techniques like electron microscopy and limited availability of centriolar markers, resulting in small scale studies and a lack solid causational evidence. With recent progress in sperm centriole biology, such as the identification of the unique composition of sperm centrioles and discovery of the atypical centriole, it is now possible to start to fill the gaps in sperm centriole epidemiology and identify the etiology of sperm centriole dysfunction in humans.},

Male infertility has become a worldwide health problem, but the etiologies of most cases are still unknown. SEPT12, a GTP-binding protein, is involved in male fertility. Two SEPT12 mutations (SEPT12T89M and SEPT12D197N) have been identified in infertile men who have a defective sperm annulus with a bent tail. The function of SEPT12 in the sperm annulus is still unclear. Here, we found that SEPT12 formed a filamentous structure with SEPT7, SEPT 6, SEPT2 and SEPT4 at the sperm annulus. The SEPT12-based septin core complex was assembled as octameric filaments comprising the SEPT proteins 12-7-6-2-2-6-7-12 or 12-7-6-4-4-6-7-12. In addition, the GTP-binding domain of SEPT12 was crucial for its interaction with SEPT7, and the N- and C-termini of SEPT12 were required for the interaction of SEPT12 with itself to polymerize octamers into filaments. Mutant mice carrying the SEPT12D197N mutation, which disrupts SEPT12 filament formation, showed a disorganized sperm annulus, bent tail, reduced motility and loss of the SEPT ring structure at the sperm annulus. These phenotypes were also observed in an infertile man carrying SEPT12D197N. Taken together, our results demonstrate the molecular architecture of SEPT12 filaments at the sperm annulus, their mechanical support of sperm motility, and their correlation with male infertility.},

  abstract = {The annulus is a higher order septin cytoskeletal structure located between the midpiece and principal piece regions of the sperm tail. The annulus has been hypothesized to generate the diffusion barrier that exists between these two membrane domains. We tested this premise directly on septin 4 knockout mice, whose sperm are viable but lack an annulus, by following the diffusing membrane protein basigin. Basigin is normally confined to the principal piece domain on testicular and caput sperm, but undergoes relocation into the midpiece during sperm epididymal transit. On Sept4−/− sperm, domain confinement was lost, and basigin localized over the entire plasma membrane. Both immunofluorescence and immunoblotting further revealed reduced levels of basigin expression on sperm from the knockout. Testicular immunohistochemistry showed similar basigin expression and tail targeting in wild-type (WT) and Sept4−/− tubules until step 15 of spermatid development, at which point basigin was redistributed throughout the plasma membrane of Sept4−/− spermatids. The basigin outside of the tail was subsequently lost around the time of sperm release into the lumen. The redistribution in the knockout coincides with the time in WT sperm when the annulus completes its migration from the neck down to the midpiece-principal piece junction. We posit that basigin may not diffuse freely until after the annulus arrives at the midpiece-principal piece junction to restrict lateral movement. These results are the strongest evidence to date of a mammalian septin structure establishing a membrane diffusion barrier., Sperm from septin 4 knockout mice, which lack the annulus, fail to develop a membrane diffusion barrier between the midpiece and principal piece domains of the sperm tail.},

In mouse and human spermatozoa, SEPT4 and other septins are found in the annulus, a cortical ring which separates the middle and principal pieces. Sept4−/− male mice are sterile due to defective morphology and motility of the sperm flagellum. In Sept4 null spermatozoa, the annulus is replaced by a fragile segment lacking cortical material, beneath which kinesin-mediated intraflagellar transport stalls. The sterility is rescued by injection of sperm into oocytes, demonstrating that each Sept4 null spermatozoon carries an intact haploid genome. The annulus/septin ring is also disorganized in spermatozoa from a subset of human patients with asthenospermia syndrome. Thus, cortical organization based on circular assembly of the septin cytoskeleton is essential for the structural and mechanical integrity of mammalian spermatozoa.},

During spermatogenesis, Sept4 proteins were essential for proper mitochondrial architecture and establishment of the annulus, a ring-like structure in the tail region of sperm. In addition, Sept4 mutant sperm showed defects in the elimination of residual cytoplasm during sperm maturation and had increased staining for the caspase inhibitor XIAP. This is consistent with a role of the proapoptotic Sept4 protein ARTS in promoting caspase-mediated removal of cytoplasm via inhibition of XIAP.

  abstract = {Abstract Spermiogenesis constitutes the steps involved in the metamorphosis of spermatids into spermatozoa. It involves modification of several organelles in addition to the formation of several structures including the flagellum and cytoplasmic droplet. The flagellum is composed of a neck region and middle, principal, and end pieces. The axoneme composed of nine outer microtubular doublets circularly arranged to form a cylinder around a central pair of microtubules is present throughout the flagellum. The middle and principal pieces each contain specific components such as the mitochondrial sheath and fibrous sheath, respectively, while outer dense fibers are common to both. A plethora of proteins are constituents of each of these structures, with each playing key roles in functions related to the fertility of spermatozoa. At the end of spermiogenesis, a portion of spermatid cytoplasm remains associated with the released spermatozoa, referred to as the cytoplasmic droplet. The latter has as its main feature Golgi saccules, which appear to modify the plasma membrane of spermatozoa as they move down the epididymal duct and hence may be partly involved in male gamete maturation. The end product of spermatogenesis is highly streamlined and motile spermatozoa having a condensed nucleus equipped with an acrosome. Spermatozoa move through the female reproductive tract and eventually penetrate the zona pellucida and bind to the egg plasma membrane. Many proteins have been implicated in the process of fertilization as well as a plethora of proteins involved in the development of spermatids and sperm, and these are high lighted in this review.

  abstract = {Each human spermatozoon contains two remodeled centrioles that it contributes to the zygote. There, they reconstitute a centrosome that assembles the sperm aster and participates in pronuclei migration and cleavage. Thus, centriole abnormalities may be a cause of male factor infertility and failure to carry pregnancy to term. However, the precise mechanisms by which sperm centrioles contribute to embryonic development in humans is still unclear - making the search for a link between centriole abnormalities and impaired male fecundity particularly difficult. Most previous investigations into the role of centrioles during fertilization have been completed in animal models, which provide only limited information that can be translated to humans. Here, we review studies that examine the role of the sperm centrioles in the early embryo, with particular emphasis on humans. Available literature includes case studies and case-control studies, with a few retrospective and no prospective studies reported. This literature has provided some insight into morphological characteristics of sperm centrioles in the zygote and has allowed identification of some centriole abnormalities in rare cases. Many of these studies suggest centriole involvement based on phenotypes of the embryo with only indirect evidence for centriole abnormality. Overall, these studies suggest that centriole abnormalities are present in some cases of sperm with asthenoteratozoospermia and unexplained infertility. Yet, most previously published studies have been restricted by use of laborious techniques like electron microscopy and limited availability of centriolar markers, resulting in small scale studies and a lack solid causational evidence. With recent progress in sperm centriole biology, such as the identification of the unique composition of sperm centrioles and discovery of the atypical centriole, it is now possible to start to fill the gaps in sperm centriole epidemiology and identify the etiology of sperm centriole dysfunction in humans.},

  abstract = {Centrioles are conserved, self-replicating, microtubule-based 9-fold symmetric subcellular organelles that are essential for proper cell division and function. Most cells have two centrioles and maintaining this number of centrioles is important for animal development and physiology. However, how animals gain their first two centrioles during reproduction is only partially understood. It is well established that in most animals, the centrioles are contributed to the zygote by the sperm. However, in humans and many animals, the sperm centrioles are modified in their structure and protein composition, or they appear to be missing altogether. In these animals, the origin of the first centrioles is not clear. Here, we review various hypotheses on how centrioles are gained during reproduction and describe specialized functions of the zygotic centrioles. In particular, we discuss a new and atypical centriole found in sperm and zygote, the proximal centriole-like structure (PCL). We also discuss another type of atypical centriole, the “zombie” centriole, which is degenerated but functional. Together, the presence of centrioles, PCL, and zombie centrioles suggests a universal mechanism of centriole inheritance among animals and new causes of infertility. Since the atypical centrioles of sperm and zygote share similar functions with typical centrioles in somatic cells, they can provide unmatched insight into centriole biology.},

In addition, the manchette is a key element in the transport of vesicles and macromolecules to the centrosome and developing spermatid tails as well as in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. The proposed model of spermatid head shaping is based on: 1) currently known structural and molecular components of the F-actin hoops, the main cytoskeletal element of the Sertoli cell ectoplasmic specializations; 2) the molecular features of acrosome biogenesis; 3) the assembly of a subacrosomal cytoskeletal plate called the acroplaxome; and 4) the spatial relationship of the acrosome-acroplaxome complex with the manchette, a transient microtubular/actin-containing structure. During acrosome biogenesis, the acroplaxome becomes the nucleation site to which Golgi-derived proacrosomal vescicles tether and fuse. The acroplaxome has at least two functions: it anchors the developing acrosome to the elongating spermatid head. It may also provide a mechanical scaffolding plate during the shaping of the spermatid nucleus. The plate is stabilized by a marginal ring with junctional complex characteristics, adjusting to exogenous clutching forces generated by the stack of Sertoli cell F-actin-containing hoops applied to the elongating spermatid head. A tubulobulbar complex, formed by cytoplasmic processes protruding from the elongating spermatid head extending into the adjacent Sertoli cell, is located at the concave side of the spermatid head. The tubulobulbar complex might provide stabilizing conditions, together with the actin-afadin-nectin-2/nectin-3 adhesion unit, to enable sustained and balanced clutching exogenous forces applied during the elongation of the spermatid head.},

  abstract = {The shaping of the mammalian sperm involves the elongation and condensation of the spermatid nucleus, the development of the acrosome, and the transient appearance of the microtubular manchette. F-actin-containing ectoplasmic hoops of Sertoli cells embrace the upper third of the spermatid head during elongation. During acrosomal biogenesis, proacrosomal vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus, dock and fuse along the acroplaxome, an F-actin/keratin 5-containing cytoskeletal plate. The acroplaxome consists of a bent plate and a marginal ring encircling the spermatid nucleus. It anchors the developing acrosome to the spermatid nucleus. The manchette, consisting of a perinuclear rings with inserted microtubules, lies subjacent to the marginal ring of the acroplaxome. During spermatid elongation, the two overlapping rings reduce their diameter to fit, in a sleeve-like fashion, the decreasing diameter of the spermatid nucleus. The acroplaxome may provide a planar scaffold to modulate exogenous constriction forces generated by Sertoli cell F-actin hoops during spermatid head elongation. The dynamics of the F-actin cytoskeleton, one of the components of the acroplaxome and Sertoli cell hoops, can be regulated by tyrosine kinases, which target cortactin, an F-actin-associated protein. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin correlates with a reduction in the crosslinking properties of F-actin. Phosphorylated cortactin and tyrosine kinase Fer are present in the acroplaxome, thus supporting a role of this F-actin remodelling pathway during spermatid head shaping. Keratin 5, an additional component of the acroplaxome, may also undergo dynamic reorganization during spermatid head elongation. We postulate that the F-actin/keratin 5 cytoskeleton in the acroplaxome may undergo a dynamic reorganization to modulate exogenous shear forces exerted by Sertoli cell F-actin hoops during spermatid head shaping. The acroplaxome-manchette perinuclear rings may reduce their diameter to balance exogenous constriction forces generated by the embracing Sertoli cell F-actin hoops and guide nuclear elongation.},

  abstract = {Sperm malformation is one of the main reasons for male infertility, but the precise mechanisms of this process remain undiscovered. The major process of spermiogenesis is sperm head shaping. Cytoskeleton is a crucial unit in this process, as the acroplaxome and manchette are two kinds of momentous structures cooperated with various functional proteins to insure the formation of acrosome and nucleus. One is primarily formed by filamentous actin (F-actin) and responsible for transverse acrosome extension and concentration, another plays as the mainstay of nuclear deformation through circular arrangement of microtubules (MTs). We suspect that the acroplaxome alone cannot maintain such a spatial framework of the acrosome. Previous studies have also revealed that a nucleus without acrosome could not induce the formation of ectoplasmic specialization. In this review, we integrated most of the key proteins that have been proven to participate in the essential developmental steps of post-meiosis. We also propose that the ambient MTs of the acrosome might be emanated from the Golgi apparatus. They form a novel cytoskeleton termed acroframosome (AFS) to transport vesicles and proteins during acrosome biogenesis. The hypothesis of the acroframosome-acroplaxome-manchette (AAM) cytoskeletal system is likely to be the axis of head-to-tail spermiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Nuclear shaping is a critical event during sperm development as demonstrated by the incidence of male infertility associated with abnormal sperm ad shaping. Herein, we demonstrate that mouse and rat spermatids assemble in the subacrosomal space a cytoskeletal scaffold containing F-actin and Sak57, a keratin ortholog. The cytoskeletal plate, designated acroplaxome, anchors the developing acrosome to the nuclear envelope. The acroplaxome consists of a marginal ring containing keratin 5 10-nm-thick filaments and F-actin. The ring is closely associated with the leading edge of the acrosome and to the nuclear envelope during the elongation of the spermatid head. Anchorage of the acroplaxome to the gradually shaping nucleus is not disrupted by hypotonic treatment and brief Triton X-100 extraction. By examining spermiogenesis in the azh mutant mouse, characterized by abnormal spermatid/sperm head shaping, we have determined that a deformity of the spermatid nucleus is restricted to the acroplaxome region. These findings lead to the suggestion that the acroplaxome nucleates an F-actin–keratin-containing assembly with the purpose of stabilizing and anchoring the developing acrosome during spermatid nuclear elongation. The acroplaxome may also provide a mechanical planar scaffold modulating external clutching forces generated by a stack of Sertoli cell F-actin–containing hoops encircling the elongating spermatid nucleus.},

There are extensive restructuring of AJ (e.g., ectoplasmic specialization, ES, a testis-specific AJ) at the Sertoli–Sertoli cell interface (basal ES) and Sertoli-elongating spermatid interface (apical ES) during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis to facilitate the migration of developing germ cells across the seminiferous epithelium. Furthermore, recent findings have shown that ES also confers cell orientation and polarity in the seminiferous epithelium, illustrating that some of the functions initially ascribed to tight junctions (TJ), such as conferring cell polarity, are also part of the inherent properties of the AJ (e.g., apical ES) in the testis. The biology and regulation based on recent studies in the testis are of interest to cell biologists in the field, in particular their regulation, which perhaps is applicable to tumorigenesis.},

It is confined to the interface between Sertoli cells at the blood–testis barrier, known as the basal ES, as well as between Sertoli cells and developing spermatids designated the apical ES. The ES shares features of adherens junctions, tight junctions and focal contacts. By adopting the best features of each junction type, this hybrid nature of ES facilitates the extensive junction-restructuring events in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. For instance, the α6β1-integrin–laminin 333 complex, which is usually limited to the cell–matrix interface in other epithelia to facilitate cell movement, is a putative apical ES constituent. Furthermore, JAM-C and CAR, two tight junction integral membrane proteins, are also components of apical ES involving in spermatid orientation. We discuss herein the mechanisms that maintain the cross-talk between ES and blood–testis barrier to facilitate cell movement and orientation in the seminiferous epithelium.},

  abstract = {Sperm malformation is one of the main reasons for male infertility, but the precise mechanisms of this process remain undiscovered. The major process of spermiogenesis is sperm head shaping. Cytoskeleton is a crucial unit in this process, as the acroplaxome and manchette are two kinds of momentous structures cooperated with various functional proteins to insure the formation of acrosome and nucleus. One is primarily formed by filamentous actin (F-actin) and responsible for transverse acrosome extension and concentration, another plays as the mainstay of nuclear deformation through circular arrangement of microtubules (MTs). We suspect that the acroplaxome alone cannot maintain such a spatial framework of the acrosome. Previous studies have also revealed that a nucleus without acrosome could not induce the formation of ectoplasmic specialization. In this review, we integrated most of the key proteins that have been proven to participate in the essential developmental steps of post-meiosis. We also propose that the ambient MTs of the acrosome might be emanated from the Golgi apparatus. They form a novel cytoskeleton termed acroframosome (AFS) to transport vesicles and proteins during acrosome biogenesis. The hypothesis of the acroframosome-acroplaxome-manchette (AAM) cytoskeletal system is likely to be the axis of head-to-tail spermiogenesis.},

  abstract = {To fuse with oocytes, spermatozoa of eutherian mammals must pass through extracellular coats, the cumulus cell layer, and the zona pellucida (ZP). It is generally believed that the acrosome reaction (AR) of spermatozoa, essential for zona penetration and fusion with oocytes, is triggered by sperm contact with the zona pellucida. Therefore, in most previous studies of sperm–oocyte interactions in the mouse, the cumulus has been removed before insemination to facilitate the examination of sperm–zona interactions. We used transgenic mouse spermatozoa, which enabled us to detect the onset of the acrosome reaction using fluorescence microscopy. We found that the spermatozoa that began the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona were able to penetrate the zona and fused with the oocyte's plasma membrane. In fact, most fertilizing spermatozoa underwent the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona pellucida of cumulus-enclosed oocytes, at least under the experimental conditions we used. The incidence of in vitro fertilization of cumulus-free oocytes was increased by coincubating oocytes with cumulus cells, suggesting an important role for cumulus cells and their matrix in natural fertilization.},

NPM treatment efficiently solubilized histones while maintaining quality and quantity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses using NPM-treated sperm demonstrated the predominant localization of H4 to distal intergenic regions, whereas modified histones exhibited a modification-dependent preferential enrichment in specific genomic elements, such as H3K4me3 at CpG-rich promoters and H3K9me3 in satellite repeats, respectively, implying the existence of machinery protecting modified histones from eviction.},

  abstract = {Understanding how DNA is packaged in the mammalian sperm cell has important implications for human infertility as well as for the cell biology. Recent advances in the study of mammalian sperm chromatin structure and function have altered our perception of this highly condensed, inert chromatin. Sperm DNA is packaged very tightly to protect the DNA during the transit that occurs before fertilization. However, this condensation cannot sacrifice chromosomal elements that are essential for the embryo to access the correct sequences of the paternal genome for proper initiation of the embryonic developmental program. The primary levels of the sperm chromatin structure can be divided into three main categories: the large majority of DNA is packaged by protamines, a smaller amount (2–15\%) retains histone-bound chromatin and the DNA is attached to the nuclear matrix at roughly 50 kb intervals. Current data suggest that the latter two structural elements are transferred to the paternal pronucleus after fertilization where they have important functional roles. The nuclear matrix organization is essential for DNA replication, and the histone-bound chromatin identifies genes that are important for embryonic development. These data support the emerging view of the sperm genome as providing, in addition to the paternal DNA sequence, a structural framework that includes molecular regulatory factors that are required for proper embryonic development.},

Vertebrates have from one to 15 protamine genes per haploid genome, which are clustered together on the same chromosome. Comparison of protamine gene and amino-acid sequences suggests that the family evolved from specialized histones through protamine-like proteins to the true protamines. Structural elements present in all true protamines are a series of arginine-rich DNA-anchoring domains (often containing a mixture of arginine and lysine residues in non-mammalian protamines) and multiple phosphorylation sites. The two protamines found in mammals, P1 and P2, are the most widely studied. P1 packages sperm DNA in all mammals, whereas protamine P2 is present only in the sperm of primates, many rodents and a subset of other placental mammals. P2, but not P1, is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing after binding to DNA and also binds a zinc atom, the function of which is not known. P1 and P2 are phosphorylated soon after their synthesis, but after binding to DNA most of the phosphate groups are removed and cysteine residues are oxidized, forming disulfide bridges that link the protamines together. Both P1 and P2 have been shown to be required for normal sperm function in primates and many rodents.},

The nucleus polarizes to one side of the cell as the nucleus condenses and elongates, and the microtubule-based manchette sculpts the nucleus into its species-specific head shape. The assembly of the central component of the sperm flagellum, known as the axoneme, begins early in spermiogenesis, and is followed by the assembly of secondary structures needed for normal flagella. The final remodelling of the mature elongated spermatid occurs during spermiation, when the spermatids line up along the luminal edge, shed their residual cytoplasm and are ultimately released into the lumen. Defects in spermiogenesis and spermiation are manifested as low sperm number, abnormal sperm morphology and poor motility and are commonly observed during reproductive toxicant administration, as well as in genetically modified mouse models of male infertility. This chapter summarizes the major physiological processes and the most commonly observed defects in spermiogenesis and spermiation, to aid in the diagnosis of the potential mechanisms that could be perturbed by experimental manipulation such as reproductive toxicant administration.},

  abstract = {Spermiogenesis is a long process whereby haploid spermatids derived from the meiotic divisions of spermatocytes undergo metamorphosis into spermatozoa. It is subdivided into distinct steps with 19 being identified in rats, 16 in mouse and 8 in humans. Spermiogenesis extends over 22.7 days in rats and 21.6 days in humans. In this part, we review several key events that take place during the development of spermatids from a structural and functional point of view. During early spermiogenesis, the Golgi apparatus forms the acrosome, a lysosome-like membrane bound organelle involved in fertilization. The endoplasmic reticulum undergoes several topographical and structural modifications including the formation of the radial body and annulate lamellae. The chromatoid body is fully developed and undergoes structural and functional modifications at this time. It is suspected to be involved in RNA storing and processing. The shape of the spermatid head undergoes extensive structural changes that are species-specific, and the nuclear chromatin becomes compacted to accommodate the stream-lined appearance of the sperm head. Microtubules become organized to form a curtain or manchette that associates with spermatids at specific steps of their development. It is involved in maintenance of the sperm head shape and trafficking of proteins in the spermatid cytoplasm. During spermiogenesis, many genes/proteins have been implicated in the diverse dynamic events occurring at this time of development of germ cells and the absence of some of these have been shown to result in subfertility or infertility.

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis, a study of germ cell development, is a long, orderly, and well-defined process occurring in seminiferous tubules of the testis. It is a temporal event whereby undifferentiated spermatogonial germ cells evolve into maturing spermatozoa over a period of several weeks. Spermatogenesis is characterized by three specific functional phases: proliferation, meiosis, and differentiation, and it involves spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. Germ cells at steps of development form various cellular associations or stages, with 6, 12, and 14 specific stages being identified in human, mouse, and rat, respectively. The stages evolve over time in a given area of the seminiferous tubule forming a cycle of the seminiferous epithelium that has a well-defined duration for a given species. In this part, we discuss the proliferation and meiotic phase whereby spermatogonia undergo several mitotic divisions to form spermatocytes that undergo two meiotic divisions to form haploid spermatids. In the rat, spermatogonia can be subdivided into several classes: stem cells (As), proliferating cells (Apr, Aal), and differentiating cells (A1–A4, In, B). They are dependent on a specific microenvironment (niche) contributed by Sertoli, myoid, and Leydig cells for proper development. Spermatogonia possess several surface markers whereby they can be identified from each other. During meiosis, spermatocytes undergo chromosomal pairing, synapsis, and genetic exchange as well as transforming into haploid cells following meiosis. The meiotic cells form specific structural entities such as the synaptonemal complex and sex body. Many genes involved in spermatogonial renewal and the meiotic process have been identified and shown to be essential for this event. Microsc. Res. Tech., 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The production of highly specialized spermatozoa from undifferentiated spermatogonia is a strictly organized and programmed process requiring extensive restructuring of the entire cell. One of the most remarkable cellular transformations accompanying the various phases of spermatogenesis is the profound remodelling of the nuclear architecture, in which the nuclear envelope (NE) seems to be crucially involved. In recent years, several proteins from the distinct layers forming the NE (i.e. the inner and outer nuclear membranes as well as the nuclear lamina) have been associated with meiosis and/or spermiogenesis in different mammalian species. Among these are A- and B-type lamins, Dpy-19-like protein 2 (DPY19L2), lamin B receptor (LBR), lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), LAP2/emerin/MAN1 (LEM) domain-containing proteins, spermatogenesis-associated 46 (SPATA46) and diverse elements of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, namely Sad-1/UNC-84 homology (SUN) and Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology (KASH) domain-containing proteins. Herein, we summarize the current state of the art on the cellular and subcellular distribution of NE proteins expressed during mammalian spermatogenesis, and discuss the latest research developments regarding their testis-specific functions. This review provides a comprehensive and innovative overview of the NE network as a regulatory platform and as an essential determinant of efficient meiotic chromosome recombination as well as spermiogenesis-associated nuclear remodelling and differentiation in mammalian male germline cells. Thus, this review provides important novel insights on the biological relevance of NE proteins for male fertility.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination generates new genetic variation and assures the proper segregation of chromosomes in gametes. PRDM9, a zinc finger protein with histone methyltransferase activity, initiates meiotic recombination by binding DNA at recombination hotspots and directing the position of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). The DSB repair mechanism suggests that hotspots should eventually self-destruct, yet genome-wide recombination levels remain constant, a conundrum known as the hotspot paradox. To test if PRDM9 drives this evolutionary erosion, we measured activity of the Prdm9Cst allele in two Mus musculus subspecies, M.m. castaneus, in which Prdm9Cst arose, and M.m. domesticus, into which Prdm9Cst was introduced experimentally. Comparing these two strains, we find that haplotype differences at hotspots lead to qualitative and quantitative changes in PRDM9 binding and activity. Using Mus spretus as an outlier, we found most variants affecting PRDM9Cst binding arose and were fixed in M.m. castaneus, suppressing hotspot activity. Furthermore, M.m. castaneus×M.m. domesticus F1 hybrids exhibit novel hotspots, with large haplotype biases in both PRDM9 binding and chromatin modification. These novel hotspots represent sites of historic evolutionary erosion that become activated in hybrids due to crosstalk between one parent's Prdm9 allele and the opposite parent's chromosome. Together these data support a model where haplotype-specific PRDM9 binding directs biased gene conversion at hotspots, ultimately leading to hotspot erosion.},

  abstract = {The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA–binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in metazoans.},

In addition to having a role in transposon silencing, piRNAs in diverse organisms function in the regulation of cellular genes. In some cases, piRNAs have shown transgenerational inheritance to pass on the memory of “self” and “nonself,” suggesting a contribution to various cellular processes over generations. Many piRNA factors have been identified; however, both the molecular mechanisms leading to the production of mature piRNAs and the effector phases of gene silencing are still enigmatic.

Here, we report the involvement of pachytene piRNAs in instructing massive mRNA elimination in mouse elongating spermatids (ES). We demonstrate that a piRNA-induced silencing complex (pi-RISC) containing murine PIWI (MIWI) and deadenylase CAF1 is selectively assembled in ES, which is responsible for inducing mRNA deadenylation and decay via a mechanism that resembles the action of miRNAs in somatic cells. Such a highly orchestrated program appears to take full advantage of the enormous repertoire of diversified targeting capacity of pachytene piRNAs derived from nontransposon intergenic regions. These findings suggest that pachytene piRNAs are responsible for inactivating vast cellular programs in preparation for sperm production from ES.},

We have isolated Tcr by positional cloning and show that it is a member of a novel protein kinase gene family, designated Smok, which is expressed late during spermiogenesis. Smok kinases are components of a signal cascade which may control sperm motility. Tcr has a reduced kinase activity, which may allow it to counterbalance a signalling impairment caused by the distorter/sterility loci.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mendel9s first law dictates that alleles segregate randomly during meiosis and are distributed to offspring with equal frequency, requiring sperm to be functionally independent of their genetic payload. Developing mammalian spermatids have been thought to accomplish this by freely sharing RNA from virtually all genes through cytoplasmic bridges, equalizing allelic gene expression across different genotypes. Applying single cell RNA sequencing to developing spermatids, we identify a large class of mammalian genes whose allelic expression ratio is informative of the haploid genotype, which we call genoinformative markers (GIMs). 29\% of spermatid-expressed genes in mice and 47\% in non-human primates are not uniformly shared, and instead show a confident allelic expression bias of at least 2-fold towards the haploid genotype. This property of GIMs was significantly conserved between individuals and between rodents and primates. Consistent with the interpretation of specific RNA localization resulting in incomplete sharing through cytoplasmic bridges, we observe a strong depletion of GIM transcripts from chromatoid bodies, structures involved in shuttling RNA across cytoplasmic bridges, and an enrichment for 3′ UTR motifs involved in RNA localization. If GIMs are translated and functional in the context of fertility, they would be able to violate Mendel9s first law, leading to selective sweeps through a population. Indeed, we show that GIMs are enriched for signatures of positive selection, accounting for dozens of recent mouse, human, and primate selective sweeps. Intense selection at the sperm level risks evolutionary conflict between germline and somatic function, and GIMs show evidence of avoiding this conflict by exhibiting more testis-specific gene expression, paralogs, and isoforms than expression-matched control genes. The widespread existence of GIMs suggests that selective forces acting at the level of individual mammalian sperm are much more frequent than commonly believed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using a monoclonal anti-SC antibody we isolated cDNAs encoding a major component of SCs which is localized specifically in synapsed segments of meiotic prophase chromosomes. The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence of a full-length cDNA, named SCP1, consists of 946 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 111 kDa. It shares several features with nuclear lamins and some recently identified nuclear matrix proteins. The major part of SCP1 consists of long stretches capable of forming amphipathic alpha-helices. This region shows amino acid sequence similarity to the coiled-coil region of myosin heavy chain. A leucine zipper is included in this region. The carboxy-terminus has two small basic domains and several S/T-P-X-X motifs, which are characteristic of DNA-binding proteins. One of these motifs is a potential target site for p34cdc2 protein kinase. The amino-terminus is acidic and relatively proline-rich, but does not contain the S/T-P-X-X motif. The transcription of the gene encoding SCP1 is restricted to zygotene-diplotene spermatocytes. A polyclonal antiserum raised against the fusion protein of one of the cDNA clones recognizes a single protein on Western blots of isolated SCs, with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the antigen recognized by the original monoclonal antibody (mAb), IX5B2. From a detailed comparison of the immunogold labelling of rat SCs by mAb IX5B2 and the polyclonal anti-fusion protein antiserum respectively, we tentatively infer that the carboxy-terminus of SCP1 is orientated towards the lateral elements and that the other domains of the protein extend towards the central region between the lateral elements. We conclude that SCP1 is the major component of the transverse filaments of SCs, and speculate that it has evolved by specialization of a nuclear matrix protein.},

  abstract = {The ability to express or deplete proteins in living cells is crucial for the study of biological processes. Viral vectors are often useful to deliver DNA constructs to cells that are difficult to transfect by other methods. Lentiviruses have the additional advantage of being able to integrate into the genomes of non-dividing mammalian cells. However, existing viral expression systems generally require different vector backbones for expression of cDNA, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) and provide limited drug selection markers. Furthermore, viral backbones are often recombinogenic in bacteria, complicating the generation and maintenance of desired clones. Here, we describe a collection of 59 vectors that comprise an integrated system for constitutive or inducible expression of cDNAs, shRNAs or miRNAs, and use a wide variety of drug selection markers. These vectors are based on the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) whereby the cDNA, shRNA or miRNA of interest is cloned into an Entry vector and then recombined into a Destination vector that carries the chosen viral backbone and drug selection marker. This recombination reaction generates the desired product with {$>$}95\% efficiency and greatly reduces the frequency of unwanted recombination in bacteria. We generated Destination vectors for the production of both retroviruses and lentiviruses. Further, we characterized each vector for its viral titer production as well as its efficiency in expressing or depleting proteins of interest. We also generated multiple types of vectors for the production of fusion proteins and confirmed expression of each. We demonstrated the utility of these vectors in a variety of functional studies. First, we show that the FKBP12 Destabilization Domain system can be used to either express or deplete the protein of interest in mitotically-arrested cells. Also, we generate primary fibroblasts that can be induced to senesce in the presence or absence of DNA damage. Finally, we determined that both isoforms of the AT-Rich Interacting Domain 4B (ARID4B) protein could induce G1 arrest when overexpressed. As new technologies emerge, the vectors in this collection can be easily modified and adapted without the need for extensive recloning.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML-or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

  shorttitle = {Poly Peak Parser},
  abstract = {Background: Genome editing techniques, including ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR, have created a need to rapidly screen many F1 individuals to identify carriers of indels and determine the sequences of the mutations. Current techniques require multiple clones of the targeted region to be sequenced for each individual, which is inefficient when many individuals must be analyzed. Direct Sanger sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified region surrounding the target site is efficient, but Sanger sequencing genomes heterozygous for an indel results in a string of “double peaks” due to the mismatched region. Results: To facilitate indel identification, we developed an online tool called Poly Peak Parser (available at http://yost.genetics.utah.edu/software.php) that is able to separate chromatogram data containing ambiguous base calls into wild-type and mutant allele sequences. This tool allows the nature of the indel to be determined from a single sequencing run per individual performed directly on a PCR product spanning the targeted site, without cloning. Conclusions: The method and algorithm described here facilitate rapid identification and sequence characterization of heterozygous mutant carriers generated by genome editing. Although designed for screening F1 individuals, this tool can also be used to identify heterozygous indels in many contexts. Developmental Dynamics 243:1632–1636, 2014. © 2014 The Authors.

A subset of these progenitors differentiates into Sertoli cells, a process characterized by a highly dynamic genetic program consisting of sequential waves of gene expression. Another subset of multipotent cells maintains their progenitor state but undergoes significant transcriptional changes restricting their competence toward a steroidogenic fate required for the differentiation of fetal Leydig cells. Our findings confirm the presence of a unique multipotent progenitor population in the gonadal primordium that gives rise to both supporting and interstitial lineages.

Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early SSC state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants, and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant SSCs.

Self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide the foundation for testis homeostasis, yet mechanisms that control their functions in mammals are poorly defined. We used microarray transcript profiling to identify specific genes whose expressions are augmented in the SSC-enriched Thy1+ germ cell fraction of mouse pup testes. Comparisons of gene expression in the Thy1+ germ cell fraction with the Thy1-depleted testis cell population identified 202 genes that are expressed 10-fold or higher in Thy1+ cells. This database provided a mining tool to investigate specific characteristics of SSCs and identify novel mechanisms that potentially influence their functions. These analyses revealed that colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (Csf1r) gene expression is enriched in Thy1+ germ cells. Addition of recombinant colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf1), the specific ligand for Csf1r, to culture media significantly enhanced the self-renewal of SSCs in heterogeneous Thy1+ spermatogonial cultures over a 63-day period without affecting total germ cell expansion. In vivo, expression of Csf1 in both pre-pubertal and adult testes was localized to clusters of Leydig cells and select peritubular myoid cells. Collectively, these results identify Csf1 as an extrinsic stimulator of SSC self-renewal and implicate Leydig and myoid cells as contributors of the testicular stem cell niche in mammals.},

Continual spermatogenesis relies on the activities of a tissue-specific stem cell population referred to as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Fate decisions of stem cells are influenced by their niche environments, a major component of which is soluble factors secreted by support cells. At present, the factors that constitute the SSC niche are undefined. We explored the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) signaling via its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in regulation of mouse SSC fate decisions. Immunofluorescent staining for CXCL12 protein in cross sections of testes from both pup and adult mice revealed its localization at the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules. Within the undifferentiated spermatogonial population of mouse testes, a fraction of cells were found to express CXCR4 and possess stem cell capacity. Inhibition of CXCR4 signaling in primary cultures of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia resulted in SSC loss, in part by reducing proliferation and increasing the transition to a progenitor state primed for differentiation upon stimulation by retinoic acid. In addition, CXCL12–CXCR4 signaling in mouse SSCs was found to be important for colonization of recipient testes following transplantation, possibly by influencing homing to establish stem-cell niches. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR4 signaling in testes of adult mice impaired SSC maintenance, leading to loss of the germline. Collectively, these findings indicate that CXCL12 is an important component of the growth factor milieu of stem cells in mammalian testes and that it signals via the CXCR4 to regulate maintenance of the SSC pool.},

First, DNA hypomethylation at embryonic developmental genes supports their epigenetic “poising” in hSSCs for future/embryonic expression, while core pluripotency genes (OCT4 and NANOG) were transcriptionally and epigenetically repressed. Interestingly, open chromatin in hSSCs was strikingly enriched in binding sites for pioneer factors (NFYA/B, DMRT1, and hormone receptors). Remarkably, single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis identified four cellular/developmental states during hSSC differentiation, involving major transitions in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulators, splicing and signaling factors, and glucose/mitochondria regulators. Overall, our results outline the dynamic chromatin/transcription landscape operating in hSSCs and identify crucial molecular pathways that accompany the transition from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation.},

In the Drosophila male germline, local activation of the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway maintains stem cells; germline stem cells lacking Jak-STAT signaling differentiate into spermatogonia without self-renewal. By conditionally manipulating Jak-STAT signaling, we find that spermatogonia that have initiated differentiation and are undergoing limited mitotic (transit-amplifying) divisions can repopulate the niche and revert to stem cell identity. Thus, in the appropriate microenvironment, transit-amplifying cells dedifferentiate, becoming functional stem cells during tissue regeneration.
Differentiated spermatogonia can repopulate the stem cell niche, reverting to stem cell identity through alteration of their signaling pathways.

In mice, it is believed that a homogeneous stem cell population of single spermatogonia supports spermatogenesis, and that differentiation, which is accompanied by the formation of connected cells (cysts) of increasing length, is linear and nonreversible. We evaluated this model with the use of lineage analysis and live imaging, and found that this putative stem cell population is not homogeneous. Instead, the stem cell pool that supports steady-state spermatogenesis is contained within a subpopulation of single spermatogonia. We also found that cysts are not committed to differentiation and appear to recover stem cell potential by fragmentation, and that the fate of individual spermatogonial populations was markedly altered during regeneration after damage. Thus, there are multiple and reversible paths from stem cells to differentiation, and these may also occur in other systems.

By examining single-cell dynamics of GFRα1+ stem cells in vivo, we evaluate an alternative hypothesis that, through fragmentation, syncytial spermatogonia also contribute to stem cell function in homeostasis. We use live imaging and pulse labeling to quantitatively determine the fates of individual GFRα1+ cells and find that, during steady-state spermatogenesis, the entire GFRα1+ population comprises a single stem cell pool, in which cells continually interconvert between A\textsubscript{s} and syncytial states. A minimal biophysical model, relying only on the rates of incomplete cell division and syncytial fragmentation, precisely predicts the stochastic fates of GFRα1+ cells during steady state and postinsult regeneration.

Asynapsed homologs are transcriptionally inactivated by meiotic silencing, which serves a surveillance function and in males drives meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Silencing depends on the DNA damage response (DDR) network, but how DDR proteins engage repressive chromatin marks is unknown. We identify the histone H3-lysine-9 methyltransferase SETDB1 as the bridge linking the DDR to silencing in male mice. At the onset of silencing, X chromosome H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) enrichment is downstream of DDR factors. Without \emph{Setdb1}, the X chromosome accrues DDR proteins but not H3K9me3. Consequently, sex chromosome remodeling and silencing fail, causing germ cell apoptosis. Our data implicate TRIM28 in linking the DDR to SETDB1 and uncover additional factors with putative meiotic XY-silencing functions.

Analyzing our single-cell transcriptomic maps of human and mouse spermatogenesis, we provide evidence that this widespread transcription serves to maintain DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through 9transcriptional scanning9. Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary time-scales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions.

Determination of those transcripts expressed specifically by germ cells should provide an inclusive list of probable critical proteins. Here, total mouse testis transcript profiles were trimmed of transcripts found in cultures enriched in Sertoli or interstitial cells to yield a germ cell-enriched transcript profile. Monitoring of changes of this profile in the developing testis identified 1,652 genes whose transcript abundance increased markedly coincident with the onset of meiosis. Remarkably, 351 of these genes (≈20\%) appear to be expressed only in the male germline. Germ cell-specific transcripts are much less common earlier in testis development. Further analysis of the UniGene EST database coupled with quantitative PCR indicates that ≈4\% of the mouse genome is dedicated to expression in postmeiotic male germ cells. Most or many of the protein products of these transcripts are probably retained in mature spermatozoa. Targeted disruption of 19 of these genes has indicated that a majority have roles critical for normal fertility. Thus, we find an astonishing number of genes expressed specifically by male germ cells late in development. This extensive group provides a plethora of potential targets for germ cell-directed contraception and a staggering number of candidate proteins that could be critical for fertilization.},

The coordinated maturation of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids suggests the existence of precise programs of gene expression in these cells and in their neighboring somatic Sertoli cells. The objective of this study was to identify the genes that execute these programs. Rat seminiferous tubules at stages I, II–III, IV–V, VI, VIIa,b, VIIc,d, VIII, IX–XI, XII, and XIII–XIV of the cycle were isolated by microdissection, whereas Sertoli cells, spermatogonia plus early spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids were purified from enzymatically dispersed testes. Microarray analysis by using Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays identified 16,971 probe sets that recognized testicular transcripts, and 398 of these were identified as testis-specific. Expression of 1,286 probe sets were found to differ at least 4-fold between two cell types and also across the stages of the cycle. Pathway and annotated cluster analyses of those probe sets predicted that entire biological pathways and processes are regulated cyclically in specific cells. Important among these are the cell cycle, DNA repair, and embryonic neuron development. Taken together, these data indicate that stage-regulated gene expression is a widespread and fundamental characteristic of spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells.},

Mutations in the prom-1 locus cause a strong reduction in bivalent formation, which results in increased embryonic lethality and a Him phenotype. Furthermore, retarded and asynchronous nuclear reorganization as well as reduced homologous synapsis occur during meiotic prophase. Accumulation of recombination protein RAD-51 in meiotic nuclei suggests disturbed repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Nuclei in prom-1 mutant gonads timely complete mitotic proliferation and premeiotic replication, but they undergo prolonged delay upon meiotic entry. We, therefore, propose that prom-1 regulates the timely progression through meiotic prophase I and that in its absence the recognition of homologous chromosomes is strongly impaired.},

  abstract = {The fibrous sheath is a unique cytoskeletal structure surrounding the axoneme and outer dense fibers and defines the extent of the principal piece region of the sperm flagellum. It consists of two longitudinal columns connected by closely arrayed semicircular ribs that assemble from distal to proximal throughout spermiogenesis. The fibrous sheath is believed to influence the degree of flexibility, plane of flagellar motion, and the shape of the flagellar beat. Nearly half of the protein in fibrous sheaths isolated from mouse sperm is AKAP4. This protein and two others, AKAP3 and TAKAP-80, have anchoring sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. AKAP3 also anchors ropporin, a spermatogenic cell-specific protein that is linked through rhophilin to the small GTPase Rho. Other proteins associated with the fibrous sheath include two enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-s (GAPDS) is the product of a gene expressed only in spermatogenic cells, while hexokinase type 1-s (HK1-S) is derived from alternative transcripts present only in spermatogenic cells. Most of the other glycolytic enzymes in sperm have unique structural or functional properties. The fibrous sheath also contains a spermatogenic cell-specific member of the μ-class glutathione S-transferase family (GSTM5) and an intermediate filament-like protein (FS39). These and other observations indicate that the fibrous sheath functions as a scaffold for proteins in signaling pathways that might be involved in regulating sperm maturation, motility, capacitation, hyperactivation, and/or acrosome reaction and for enzymes in the glycolytic pathway that provide energy for the hyperactivated motility of sperm that allows them to penetrate the zona pellucida.

Here, we describe a comprehensive characterization of gene expression dynamics during sex determination based on single-cell RNA sequencing on 14,750 XX and XY mouse germ cells between embryonic days 10.5 and 16.5. By computational gene regulation inference analysis, we identified sex-specific, sequential waves of master regulator genes during germ cells differentiation and unveiled that the meiotic initiator \emph{Stra8} is regulated by positive and negative master regulators acting in an antagonistic fashion. Consistent with the importance of the somatic environment, we found that rare adrenal germ cells exhibit delayed meiosis and display altered expression of master genes controlling the female and male genetic programs. Our study provides a molecular roadmap of germ cell sex determination at single-cell resolution that will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of gonad development, function and disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we developed a multiplexed trajectory reconstruction to create a high-resolution developmental map of spermatogonia and prophase-I spermatocytes from testes of a Dazl-GFP reporter mouse. We identified three main transitions in the meiotic prophase-I: meiotic entry, the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), and concomitant pachytene activation. We validated the key features of these transitions \emph{in vivo} using single molecule FISH. Focusing on MSCI, we found that 34\% of sex chromosomal genes are induced shortly before MSCI, that silencing time is diverse and correlates with specific gene functions. These highlight a previously underappreciated level of regulation of MSCI. Finally, we found that spermatozoal genes in pachytene are activated in a temporal pattern reflecting the future anatomic and functional order of the sperm cell. Altogether we highlighted how precise and sequential changes in gene expression regulate cellular states in meiotic prophase-I.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we show that the transcription factor SOX30 plays a critical role in mouse spermatogenesis. Sox30-null mice are healthy and females are fertile, but males are sterile. In the absence of Sox30 meiosis initiates normally in both sexes but, in males, germ cell development arrests during the post-meiotic round spermatid period. In the mutant testis, acrosome and axoneme development are aberrant, multinucleated germ cells (symplasts) form and round spermatids unable to process beyond step 3 of spermiogenesis. No elongated spermatids nor spermatozoa are produced. Thus, Sox30 represents a rare example of a gene for which loss of function results in a complete arrest of spermatogenesis at the onset of spermiogenesis. Our results suggest that SOX30 mutations may underlie some instances of unexplained non-obstructive azoospermia in humans.},

Taking advantage of recent clinical development advances and rapid growth in GWAS datasets, we extend the original work using updated data, test whether genetic evidence predicts future successes and introduce statistical models adjusting for target and indication-level properties. Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III. When causal genes are clear (Mendelian traits and GWAS associations linked to coding variants), we find the use of human genetic evidence increases approval by greater than two-fold, and, for Mendelian associations, the positive association holds prospectively.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the gold standard to detect genome-wide DNA-protein binding. The binding sites of transcription factors facilitate many biological studies. Of emerging concern is the abundance of spurious sites in ChIP-seq, which are mainly caused by uneven genomic sonication and nonspecific interactions between chromatin and antibody. A "mock" IP is designed to correct for both factors, whereas a DNA input control corrects only for uneven sonication. However, a mock IP is more susceptible to technical noise than a DNA input, and empirically, these two controls perform similarly for ChIP-seq. Therefore, DNA input is currently being used almost exclusively. With a large dataset, we demonstrate that using a DNA input control results in a definable set of spurious sites, and their abundance is tightly associated with the intrinsic properties of the ChIP-seq sample. For example, compared to human cell lines, samples such as human tissues and whole worm and fly have more accessible genomes, and thus have more spurious sites. The large and varying abundance of spurious sites may impede comparative studies across multiple samples. In contrast, using a mock IP as control substantially removes these spurious sites, resulting in high-quality binding sites and facilitating their comparability across samples. Although outperformed by mock IP, DNA input is still informative and has unique advantages. Therefore, we have developed a method to use both controls in combination to further improve binding site detection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Most human aneuploidies originate maternally, due in part to the presence of highly stringent checkpoints during male meiosis. Indeed, male sterility is common among aneuploid mice used to study chromosomal abnormalities, and male germline transmission of exogenous DNA has been rarely reported. Here we show that, despite aberrant testis architecture, males of the aneuploid Tc1 mouse strain produce viable sperm and transmit human chromosome 21 to create aneuploid offspring. In these offspring, we mapped transcription, transcriptional initiation, enhancer activity, non-methylated DNA, and transcription factor binding in adult tissues. Remarkably, when compared with mice derived from female passage of human chromosome 21, the chromatin condensation during spermatogenesis and the extensive epigenetic reprogramming specific to male germline transmission resulted in almost indistinguishable patterns of transcriptional deployment. Our results reveal an unexpected tolerance of aneuploidy during mammalian spermatogenesis, and the surprisingly robust ability of mouse developmental machinery to accurately deploy an exogenous chromosome, regardless of germline transmission.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The allocation of a sequencing budget when designing single cell RNA-seq experiments requires consideration of the tradeoff between number of cells sequenced and the read depth per cell. One approach to the problem is to perform a power analysis for a univariate objective such as differential expression. However, many of the goals of single-cell analysis requires consideration of the multivariate structure of gene expression, such as clustering. We introduce an approach to quantifying the impact of sequencing depth and cell number on the estimation of a multivariate generative model for gene expression that is based on error analysis in the framework of a variational autoencoder. We find that at shallow depths, the marginal benefit of deeper sequencing per cell significantly outweighs the benefit of increased cell numbers. Above about 15,000 reads per cell the benefit of increased sequencing depth is minor.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Cell atlas projects and single-cell CRISPR screens hit the limits of current technology, as they require cost-effective profiling for millions of individual cells. To satisfy these enormous throughput requirements, we developed "single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing" (scifi) and applied it to single-cell RNA sequencing. The resulting scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial pre-indexing of single-cell transcriptomes with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using widely available droplet microfluidics. Pre-indexing allows us to load multiple cells per droplet, which increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq up to 15-fold, and it provides a straightforward way of multiplexing hundreds of samples in a single scifi-RNA-seq experiment. Compared to multi-round combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easier, faster, and more efficient workflow, thereby enabling massive-scale scRNA-seq experiments for a broad range of applications ranging from population genomics to drug screens with scRNA-seq readout. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, and we demonstrated its feasibility for human primary material by profiling TCR activation in T cells.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

On the other hand, fluorescence microscopy imaging has moved from a morphological description of tissues and cells to quantitative molecular profiling with single-molecule resolution. Recent technological developments underpinned by computational methods have started to blur the lines between imaging and omics and have made their direct correlation and seamless integration an exciting possibility. As this trend continues rapidly, it will allow us to create comprehensive molecular profiles of living systems with spatial and temporal context and subcellular resolution.

Unlike yeast and plants, where DSBs are generated near gene promoters, in many vertebrates, DSBs are enriched at hotspots determined by the DNA binding activity of the rapidly evolving zinc finger array of PRDM9 (PR domain zinc finger protein 9). PRDM9 subsequently catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 4 and lysine 36 of Histone H3 in nearby nucleosomes. Here, we identify the dual histone methylation reader ZCWPW1, which is tightly co-expressed during spermatogenesis with \emph{Prdm9} and co-evolved with \emph{Prdm9} in vertebrates, as an essential meiotic recombination factor required for efficient synapsis and repair of PRDM9-dependent DSBs. In sum, our results indicate that the evolution of a dual histone methylation writer/reader system in vertebrates facilitated a shift in genetic recombination away from a static pattern near genes towards a flexible pattern controlled by the rapidly evolving DNA binding activity of PRDM9.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we report the identification of a transcription factor—RHOX10—critical for the initial establishment of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Conditional loss of the entire 33-gene X-linked homeobox gene cluster that includes \emph{Rhox10} causes progressive spermatogenic decline, a phenotype indistinguishable from that caused by loss of only \emph{Rhox10}. We demonstrate that this phenotype results from dramatically reduced SSC generation. By using a battery of approaches, including single-cell-RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we show that \emph{Rhox10} drives SSC generation by promoting pro-spermatogonia differentiation. \emph{Rhox10} also regulates batteries of migration genes and promotes the migration of pro-spermatogonia into the SSC niche. The identification of an X-linked homeobox gene that drives the initial generation of SSCs has implications for the evolution of X-linked gene clusters and sheds light on regulatory mechanisms influencing adult stem cell generation in general.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The analyses identified transcriptional modules, one of which regulates spermatogonial gene network in neonatal germ cells. Among them, we identified Dec2, a bHLH-type transcription factor, as a transcriptional repressor for a spermatogonial differentiation factor Sohlh1. Deficiency of Dec2 in mice induces significant reduction of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and transplantation assay using Dec2-depleted cells also demonstrated the impaired efficiency of engraftment, suggesting its role in maintaining spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs).

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate single-cell RNA-sequencing data for identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 12 mouse-derived single SSCs (mSSCs) in compare with 16 mouse-derived single mesenchymal stem cells. We also aimed to find transcriptional regulators of DEGs. Collectively, 1,584 up-regulated DEGs were identified that are associated with 32 biological processes. Moreover, investigation of the expression profiles of genes including in spermatogenesis process revealed that Dazl, Ddx4, Sall4, Fkbp6, Tex15, Tex19.1, Rnf17, Piwil2, Taf7l, Zbtb16, and Cadm1 are presented in the first 30 up-regulated DEGs. We also found 12 basal transcription factors (TFs) and three sequence-specific TFs that control the expression of DEGs. Our findings also indicated that MEIS1, SMC3, TAF1, KAT2A, STAT3, GTF3C2, SIN3A, BDP1, PHC1, and EGR1 are the main central regulators of DEGs in mSSCs. In addition, we collectively detected two significant protein complexes in the protein-protein interactions network for DEGs regulators. Finally, this study introduces the major upstream kinases for the main central regulators of DEGs and the components of core protein complexes. In conclusion, this study provides a molecular blueprint to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind the biology of SSCs and offers a list of candidate factors for cell type conversion approaches and production of germ cells.},

Neonatal germ cell development provides the foundation of spermatogenesis. However, a systematic understanding of this process is still limited. To resolve cellular and molecular heterogeneity in this process, we profiled single cell transcriptomes of undifferentiated germ cells from neonatal mouse testes and employed unbiased clustering and pseudotime ordering analysis to assign cells to distinct cell states in the developmental continuum. We defined the unique transcriptional programs underlying migratory capacity, resting cellular states and apoptosis regulation in transitional gonocytes. We also identified a subpopulation of primitive spermatogonia marked by CD87 (plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor), which exhibited a higher level of self-renewal gene expression and migration potential. We further revealed a differentiation-primed state within the undifferentiated compartment, in which elevated Oct4 expression correlates with lower expression of self-renewal pathway factors, higher Rarg expression, and enhanced retinoic acid responsiveness. Lastly, a knockdown experiment revealed the role of Oct4 in the regulation of gene expression related to the MAPK pathway and cell adhesion, which may contribute to stem cell differentiation. Our study thus provides novel insights into cellular and molecular regulation during early germ cell development.},

Every animal grows from a single fertilized egg into an intricate network of cell types and organ systems. This process is captured in a lineage tree: a diagram of every cell's ancestry back to the founding zygote. Biologists have long sought to trace this cell lineage tree in individual organisms and have developed a variety of technologies to map the progeny of specific cells. However, there are billions to trillions of cells in complex organisms, and conventional approaches can only map a limited number of clonal populations per experiment. A new generation of tools that use molecular recording methods integrated with single cell profiling technologies may provide a solution. Here, we summarize recent breakthroughs in these technologies, outline experimental and computational challenges, and discuss biological questions that can be addressed using single cell dynamic lineage tracing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Meiotic recombination is initiated by genome-wide SPO11-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are processed by MRE11-mediated release of SPO11. The DSB is then resected and loaded with DMC1/RAD51 filaments that invade homologous chromosome templates. In most mammals, DSB locations (hotspots) are determined by the DNA sequence specificity of PRDM9. Here, we demonstrate the first direct detection of meiotic DSBs and resection in vertebrates by performing END-seq on mouse spermatocytes using low sample input. We find that DMC1 limits both the minimum and maximum lengths of resected DNA, whereas 53BP1, BRCA1 and EXO1 play surprisingly minimal roles in meiotic resection. Through enzymatic modifications to the END-seq protocol that mimic the in vivo processing of SPO11, we identify a novel meiotic recombination intermediate (SPO11-RI) present at all hotspots. The SPO11-bound intermediate is dependent on PRDM9 and caps the 3-prime resected end during engagement with the homologous template. We propose that SPO11-RI is generated because chromatin-bound PRDM9 asymmetrically blocks MRE11 from releasing SPO11. In Atm-/-spermatocytes, SPO11-RI is reduced while unresected DNA-bound SPO11 accumulate because of defective MRE11 initiation. Thus in addition to their global roles in governing SPO11 breakage, ATM and PRDM9 are critical local regulators of mammalian SPO11 processing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to explore cell types, states, and developmental trajectories to broaden understanding of cell heterogeneity in tissues and organs. Analysis of these sparse, high-dimensional experimental results requires dimension reduction. Several methods have been developed to estimate low-dimensional embeddings for filtered and normalized single cell data. However, methods have yet to be developed for unfiltered and unnormalized count data. We present a nonlinear latent variable model with robust, heavy-tailed error and adaptive kernel learning to estimate low-dimensional nonlinear structure in scRNA-seq data. Gene expression in a single cell is modeled as a noisy draw from a Gaussian process in high dimensions from low-dimensional latent positions. This model is called the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). We model residual errors with a heavy-tailed Student’s t-distribution to estimate a manifold that is robust to technical and biological noise. We compare our approach to common dimension reduction tools to highlight our model’s ability to enable important downstream tasks, including clustering and inferring cell developmental trajectories, on available experimental data. We show that our robust nonlinear manifold is well suited for raw, unfiltered gene counts from high throughput sequencing technologies for visualization and exploration of cell states.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background
Dimensionality reduction is an indispensable analytic component for many areas of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Proper dimensionality reduction can allow for effective noise removal and facilitate many downstream analyses that include cell clustering and lineage reconstruction. Unfortunately, despite the critical importance of dimensionality reduction in scRNA-seq analysis and the vast number of dimensionality reduction methods developed for scRNA-seq studies, few comprehensive comparison studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different dimensionality reduction methods in scRNA-seq.

Results
We aim to fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a comparative evaluation of a variety of commonly used dimensionality reduction methods for scRNA-seq studies. Specifically, we compare 18 different dimensionality reduction methods on 30 publicly available scRNA-seq datasets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. We evaluate the performance of different dimensionality reduction methods for neighborhood preserving in terms of their ability to recover features of the original expression matrix, and for cell clustering and lineage reconstruction in terms of their accuracy and robustness. We also evaluate the computational scalability of different dimensionality reduction methods by recording their computational cost.

Conclusions
Based on the comprehensive evaluation results, we provide important guidelines for choosing dimensionality reduction methods for scRNA-seq data analysis. We also provide all analysis scripts used in the present study at www.xzlab.org/reproduce.html.},

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONDuring embryogenesis, pluripotent cells gradually become specialized and acquire distinct functions and morphologies. Because much of the specification process is controlled through changes in gene expression, the identification of the transcriptional trajectories underlying cell fate acquisition is paramount to understanding and manipulating development.
RATIONALETraditional approaches have studied specific fate decisions by analyzing the transcription of a few selected marker genes or by profiling isolated, predefined cell populations. The advent of large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides the means to comprehensively define the gene expression states of all embryonic cells as they acquire their fates. This technology raises the possibility of identifying the molecular trajectories that describe cell fate specification by sampling densely during embryogenesis and connecting the transcriptomes of cells that have similar gene expression profiles. However, the numerous transcriptional states and branch points, as well as the asynchrony in developmental processes, pose major challenges to the computational reconstruction of developmental trajectories from scRNA-seq data.
RESULTSWe generated single-cell transcriptomes from 38,731 cells during early zebrafish embryogenesis at high temporal resolution, spanning 12 stages from the onset of zygotic transcription through early somitogenesis. We took two complementary approaches to identify the transcriptional trajectories in the data. First, we developed a simulated diffusion-based computational approach, URD, which identified the trajectories describing the specification of 25 cell types in the form of a branching tree. Second, we identified modules of coexpressed genes and connected them across developmental time. Combining the reconstructed developmental trajectories with differential gene expression analysis uncovered gene expression cascades leading to each cell type, including previously unidentified markers and candidate regulators. Combining these trajectories with Seurat, which infers the spatial positions of cells on the basis of their transcriptomes, connected the earlier spatial position of progenitors to the later fate of their descendants.Inspection of the developmental tree led to new insights about molecular specification in zebrafish. For example, the first branch point in the tree indicated that the first molecular specification event may not only separate the germ layers but also define the axial versus nonaxial mesendoderm. Additionally, some developmental branch points contained intermediate cells that expressed genes characteristic of multiple downstream cell fates. Gene expression analysis at one such branch point (the axial mesoderm) suggested that the intermediate cells switch their specification from one fate (notochord) to another (prechordal plate). Last, analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from a Nodal-signaling mutant revealed that even at the whole-transcriptome level, mutant cells were canalized into a subset of wild-type states and did not adopt any transcriptional states not observed in wild type, despite abnormal developmental signaling.
CONCLUSIONThese findings reconstruct the gene expression trajectories during the embryogenesis of a vertebrate and highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of cell type specification. The scRNA-seq data and developmental tree provide a rich resource for future studies in zebrafish: The raw and processed data and the URD software are available for download, and the data can be browsed interactively online. Last, this approach provides a broadly applicable framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomes. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6392/eaar3131/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Developmental tree of early zebrafish embryogenesis.Single-cell transcriptomes were generated from zebrafish embryos at 12 developmental stages (six of which are shown). The transcriptional trajectories that describe the fate specification of 25 cell types were reconstructed from the data. Molecular specification is visualized with a force-directed layout, in which each cell is represented by a point (colored by developmental stage), proceeding from pluripotent cells (at the bottom center) outward to 25 distinct cell types. A subset of the identified trajectories are labeled in groups.
During embryogenesis, cells acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional states. To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.

High-throughput mapping of cellular differentiation hierarchies from single-cell data promises to empower systematic interrogations of vertebrate development and disease. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to {$>$}92,000 cells from zebrafish embryos during the first day of development. Using a graph-based approach, we mapped a cell-state landscape that describes axis patterning, germ layer formation, and organogenesis. We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-based barcoding approach (TracerSeq) for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates. Cell fates remained restricted to this landscape in embryos lacking the chordin gene. We provide web-based resources for further analysis of the single-cell data.

Gene expression genomics is a key example context. As part of a series of projects that has developed Bayesian methodology for large-scale regression, ANOVA, and latent factor models, we have extended traditional Bayesian “variable selection” priors and modelling ideas to new hierarchical sparsity priors that are providing substantial practical gains in addressing false discovery and isolating significant gene-specific parameters/effects in highly multivariate studies involving thousands of genes. We discuss and review these developments, in the contexts of multivariate regression, ANOVA, and latent factor models for multivariate gene expression data arising in either observational or designed experimental studies. The development includes the use of sparse regression components to provide gene-sample-specific normalisation/correction based on control and housekeeping factors, an important general issue and one that can be critical – and critically misleading if ignored – in many gene expression studies. Two rich data sets are used to provide context and illustration. The first data set arises from a gene expression experiment designed to investigate the transcriptional response – in terms of responsive gene subsets and their expression signatures – to interventions that upregulate a series of key oncogenes. The second data set is observational, breast cancer tumour-derived data evaluated utilising a sparse latent factor model to define and isolate factors underlying the hugely complex patterns of association in gene expression patterns.

  abstract = {Humans suffer from high rates of fetal aneuploidy, often arising from the absence of meiotic crossover recombination between homologous chromosomes. Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the SPO11 transesterase. In yeast and worms, at least one buffering mechanism, crossover homeostasis, maintains crossover numbers despite variation in DSB numbers–. We show here that mammals display progressive homeostatic control of recombination. In wild-type mouse spermatocytes, focus numbers for early recombination proteins (RAD51, DMC1) were highly variable from cell to cell, whereas foci of the crossover marker MLH1 showed little variability. Furthermore, mice with greater or fewer copies of the Spo11 gene — with correspondingly greater or fewer numbers of early recombination foci — displayed relatively invariant crossover numbers. Homeostatic control is enforced during at least two stages, after the formation of early recombination intermediates and later while these intermediates mature toward crossovers. Thus, variability within the mammalian meiotic program is robustly managed by homeostatic mechanisms to control crossover formation, probably to suppress aneuploidy. Meiotic recombination exemplifies how order can be progressively implemented in a self-organizing system despite natural cell-to-cell disparities in the underlying biochemical processes.},

Drosophila melanogaster contains two separate genes, the Mei-MCMs, which appear to have arisen from a single ancestral Mcmdc2 gene. The Mei-MCMs are involved in promoting meiotic crossovers by blocking the anticrossover activity of BLM helicase, a function presumably performed by MSH4 and MSH5 in metazoans. Here, we report that MCMDC2-deficient mice of both sexes are viable but sterile. Males fail to produce spermatozoa, and formation of primordial follicles is disrupted in females. Histology and immunocytological analyses of mutant testes revealed that meiosis is arrested in prophase I, and is characterized by persistent meiotic double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), failure of homologous chromosome synapsis and XY body formation, and an absence of crossing over. These phenotypes resembled those of MSH4/5-deficient meiocytes. The data indicate that MCMDC2 is essential for invasion of homologous sequences by RAD51- and DMC1-coated single-stranded DNA filaments, or stabilization of recombination intermediates following strand invasion, both of which are needed to drive stable homolog pairing and DSB repair via recombination in mice.},

We show that Topo IIIα stimulates DNA unwinding by BLM in a manner that is potentiated by RMI1-RMI2, and that the processivity of resection is reliant on the Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 complex. Topo IIIα localizes to the ends of double-strand breaks, thus implicating it in the recruitment of resection factors. While the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA plays a major role in imposing the 5' to 3' polarity of resection, Topo IIIα also makes a contribution in this regard. Moreover, we show that DNA2 stimulates the helicase activity of BLM. Our results thus uncover a multifaceted role of the Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 ensemble and of DNA2 in the DNA resection reaction.},

 current paper is focused on the biochemical properties of human RECQ1
 helicase. Recent cellular studies have shown that RECQ1 may participate in DNA
 repair and homologous recombination, but the exact mechanisms of how RECQ1
 performs its cellular functions remain largely unknown. Whereas RECQ1
 possesses poor helicase activity, we found here that the enzyme efficiently
 promotes DNA branch migration. Further analysis revealed that RECQ1 catalyzes
 unidirectional three-stranded branch migration with a 3′ → 5′
 polarity. We show that this RECQ1 activity is instrumental in specific
 disruption of joint molecules (D-loops) formed by a 5′ single-stranded
 DNA invading strand, which may represent dead end intermediates of homologous
 recombination in vivo. The newly found enzymatic properties of the
 RECQ1 helicase may have important implications for the function of RECQ1 in

RAD54 also stimulates RAD51 recombinase and has other activities. Here, we investigate the structural determinants for different RAD54 activities. We find that the RAD54 N-terminal domain (NTD) is responsible for initiation of BM through two coupled, but distinct steps; specific binding to Holliday junctions and RAD54 oligomerization. Furthermore, we find that the RAD54 oligomeric state can be controlled by NTD phosphorylation at S49, a CDK2 consensus site, which inhibits RAD54 oligomerization and, consequently, BM. Importantly, the effect of phosphorylation on RAD54 oligomerization is specific for BM, as it does not affect stimulation of RAD51 recombinase by RAD54. Thus, the transition of the oligomeric states provides an important control of the biological functions of RAD54 and, likely, other multifunctional proteins., RAD54 stimulates activity of the RAD51 recombinase and catalyzes branch migration of Holliday junctions during DNA repair and recombination. Here the authors show that the N-terminal domain of RAD54 mediates RAD54 oligomerization to promote branch migration, and is the target of phosphorylation that inhibits oligomerization~and branch migration but not RAD51 stimulation.},

RAD54, BLM, and RECQ1 drive BM in the 3′→5′ direction., Conclusion: The displacement strand of joint molecules (JMs) defines the polarity of BM., Significance: BM is mechanistically distinct from helicase activity of DNA translocating proteins., Several proteins have been shown to catalyze branch migration (BM) of the Holliday junction, a key intermediate in DNA repair and recombination. Here, using joint molecules made by human RAD51 or Escherichia coli RecA, we find that the polarity of the displaced ssDNA strand of the joint molecules defines the polarity of BM of RAD54, BLM, RECQ1, and RuvAB. Our results demonstrate that RAD54, BLM, and RECQ1 promote BM preferentially in the 3′→5′ direction, whereas RuvAB drives it in the 5′→3′ direction relative to the displaced ssDNA strand. Our data indicate that the helicase activity of BM proteins does not play a role in the heterology bypass. Thus, RAD54 that lacks helicase activity is more efficient in DNA heterology bypass than BLM or REQ1 helicases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the BLM helicase and BM activities require different protein stoichiometries, indicating that different complexes, monomers and multimers, respectively, are responsible for these two activities. These results define BM as a mechanistically distinct activity of DNA translocating proteins, which may serve an important function in DNA repair and recombination.},

During HR, members of the RecA/Rad51 family of recombinases must somehow search through vast quantities of DNA sequence to align and pair single-strand DNA (ssDNA) with a homologous double-strand DNA (dsDNA) template. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Rad51 as it aligns and pairs homologous DNA sequences in real time. We show that Rad51 uses a length-based recognition mechanism while interrogating dsDNA, enabling robust kinetic selection of~8-nucleotide (nt) tracts of microhomology, which kinetically confines the search to sites with a high probability of being a homologous target. Successful pairing with a ninth nucleotide coincides with an additional reduction in binding free energy, and subsequent strand exchange occurs in precise 3-nt steps, reflecting the base triplet organization of the presynaptic complex. These findings provide crucial new insights into the physical and evolutionary underpinnings of DNA recombination.},

Escherichia coli RecA is an ATP-dependent DNA-binding protein that catalyzes the DNA strand exchange reactions in homologous recombination. RecA assembles into long helical filaments on single-stranded DNA, and these presynaptic complexes are responsible for locating and pairing with a homologous duplex DNA. Recent single molecule studies have provided new insights into RecA behavior, but the potential influence of ATP in the reactions remains poorly understood. Here we examine how ATP influences the ability of the RecA presynaptic complex to interact with homologous dsDNA. We demonstrate that over short time regimes, RecA presynaptic complexes sample heterologous dsDNA similarly in the presence of either ATP or ATPγS, suggesting that initial interactions do not depend on ATP hydrolysis. In addition, RecA stabilizes pairing intermediates in three-base steps, and stepping energetics is seemingly unaltered in the presence of ATP. However, the overall dissociation rate of these paired intermediates with ATP is ∼4-fold higher than with ATPγS. These experiments suggest that ATP plays an unanticipated role in promoting the turnover of captured duplex DNA intermediates as RecA attempts to align homologous sequences during the early stages of recombination.},

To overcome the catastrophic consequences associated with fork demise, translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases such as polη promote DNA synthesis past lesions.

By using fractionated cell extracts and purified recombinant proteins, we show that polη extends DNA synthesis from D loop recombination intermediates in which an invading strand serves as the primer. Extracts from XP-V cells, which are defective in polη, exhibit severely reduced D loop extension activity. The D loop extension activity of polη is unusual, as this reaction cannot be promoted by the replicative DNA polymerase δ or by other TLS polymerases such as polι. Moreover, we find that polη interacts with RAD51 recombinase and RAD51 stimulates polη-mediated D loop extension. Our results indicate a dual function for polη at stalled replication forks: the promotion of translesion synthesis and the reinitiation of DNA synthesis by homologous recombination repair.},

Rad52 has two distinct activities: to recruit Rad51 onto single-strand (ss)DNA that is complexed with the ssDNA-binding protein, RPA, and to anneal complementary ssDNA complexed with RPA. Here, we report that Rad52 promotes annealing of the ssDNA strand that is displaced by DNA strand exchange by Rad51 and RPA, to a second ssDNA strand. An RPA that is recombination-deficient (RPA(rfa1-t11)) failed to support annealing, explaining its in vivo phenotype. Escherichia coli RecO and SSB proteins, which are functional homologues of Rad52 and RPA, also facilitated the same reaction, demonstrating its conserved nature. We also demonstrate that the two activities of Rad52, recruiting Rad51 and annealing DNA, are coordinated in DNA strand exchange and second ssDNA capture.},

  abstract = {During DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by recombination, the broken chromosome uses a homologous chromosome as a repair template. Early steps of recombination are well characterized: DSB ends assemble filaments of RecA-family proteins that catalyze homologous pairing and strand-invasion reactions. By contrast, the postinvasion steps of recombination are poorly characterized. Rad52 plays an essential role during early steps of recombination by mediating assembly of a RecA homolog, Rad51, into nucleoprotein filaments. The meiosis-specific RecA-homolog Dmc1 does not show this dependence, however. By exploiting the Rad52 independence of Dmc1, we reveal that Rad52 promotes postinvasion steps of both crossover and noncrossover pathways of meiotic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This activity resides in the N-terminal region of Rad52, which can anneal complementary DNA strands, and is independent of its Rad51-assembly function. Our findings show that Rad52 functions in temporally and biochemically distinct reactions and suggest a general annealing mechanism for reuniting DSB ends during recombination.},

In vitro, Rad52 protein preferentially binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), mediates annealing of complementary ssDNA, and stimulates Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange. Replication protein A (RPA) is a ssDNA-binding protein that is also crucial to the recombination process. Herein we report that Rad52 protein effects the annealing of RPA–ssDNA complexes, complexes that are otherwise unable to anneal. The ability of Rad52 protein to promote annealing depends on both the type of ssDNA substrate and ssDNA binding protein. RPA allows, but slows, Rad52 protein-mediated annealing of oligonucleotides. In contrast, RPA is almost essential for annealing of longer plasmid-sized DNA but has little effect on the annealing of poly(dT) and poly(dA), which are relatively long DNA molecules free of secondary structure. These results suggest that one role of RPA in Rad52 protein-mediated annealing is the elimination of DNA secondary structure. However, neither Escherichia coli ssDNA binding protein nor human RPA can substitute in this reaction, indicating that RPA has a second role in this process, a role that requires specific RPA–Rad52 protein interactions. This idea is confirmed by the finding that RPA, which is complexed with nonhomologous ssDNA, inhibits annealing but the human RPA–ssDNA complex does not. Finally, we present a model for the early steps of the repair of double-strand DNA breaks in yeast.},

A defining feature of Bloom's syndrome is an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges2. These arise from crossing over of chromatid arms during homologous recombination, a ubiquitous process that exists to repair DNA double-stranded breaks and damaged replication forks. Whereas crossing over is required in meiosis, in mitotic cells it can be associated with detrimental loss of heterozygosity. BLM forms an evolutionarily conserved complex with human topoisomerase IIIα (hTOPO IIIα)3,4, which can break and rejoin DNA to alter its topology. Inactivation of homologues of either protein leads to hyper-recombination in unicellular organisms5. Here, we show that BLM and hTOPO IIIα together effect the resolution of a recombination intermediate containing a double Holliday junction. The mechanism, which we term double-junction dissolution, is distinct from classical Holliday junction resolution and prevents exchange of flanking sequences. Loss of such an activity explains many of the cellular phenotypes of Bloom's syndrome. These results have wider implications for our understanding of the process of homologous recombination and the mechanisms that exist to prevent tumorigenesis.},

Modeling suggests that sliding can accelerate homology search by as much as 200 fold. Homology recognition can occur for as few as 6 nt of complementary basepairs with the recognition efficiency increasing for higher complementarity.

There is currently a limited understanding of how these two recombinases are organized within the meiotic presynaptic filament. Here, we used single molecule imaging to examine the properties of presynaptic complexes composed of both Rad51 and Dmc1. We demonstrate that Rad51 and Dmc1 have an intrinsic ability to self-segregate, even in the absence of any other recombination accessory proteins. Moreover, we found that the presence of Dmc1 stabilizes the adjacent Rad51 filaments, suggesting that cross-talk between these two recombinases may affect their biochemical properties. Based upon these findings, we describe a model for the organization of Rad51 and Dmc1 within the meiotic presynaptic complex, which is also consistent with in vivo observations, genetic findings, and biochemical expectations. This model argues against the existence of extensively intermixed filaments, and we propose that Rad51 and Dmc1 have intrinsic capacities to form spatially distinct filaments, suggesting that additional recombination cofactors are not required to segregate the Rad51 and Dmc1 filaments.},

With use of a separation-of-function mutant form of Rad51 that retains filament-forming but not JM-forming activity, we show that the JM activity of Rad51 is fully dispensable for meiotic recombination. The corresponding mutation in Dmc1 causes a profound recombination defect, demonstrating Dmc1’s JM activity alone is responsible for meiotic recombination. We further provide biochemical evidence that Rad51 acts with Mei5-Sae3 as a Dmc1 accessory factor. Thus, Rad51 is a multifunctional protein that catalyzes recombination directly in mitosis and indirectly, via Dmc1, during meiosis.
Duplication of a central protein in mitosis facilitated the evolution of a highly related protein required for meiosis.

We found that homology search proceeds by a probing mechanism, which commences around the break and samples preferentially on the broken chromosome. However, elements thought to instruct chromosome loops mediate homology search shortcuts, and centromeres, which cluster within the nucleus, may facilitate homology search on other chromosomes. Our study thus reveals crucial parameters for homology search in~vivo and emphasizes the importance of linear distance, chromosome architecture, and proximity for recombination efficiency.},

The exchange of genetic information between DNA strands is vital for accurate DNA repair and effective meiotic cell division. Using single-molecule methods and molecular dynamics simulations, Lee et al. show that members of the family of recombinase enzymes responsible for these strand exchange reactions search for and recognize matching DNA strands three bases at a time. A single mismatch abolishes triplet recognition, except for the meiosis-specific recombinase. This enzyme can stabilize a partially mismatched triplet, reflecting the partial homology of the DNA substrates in meiosis.
Science, this issue p. 977
DNA strand exchange plays a central role in genetic recombination across all kingdoms of life, but the physical basis for these reactions remains poorly defined. Using single-molecule imaging, we found that bacterial RecA and eukaryotic Rad51 and Dmc1 all stabilize strand exchange intermediates in precise three-nucleotide steps. Each step coincides with an energetic signature (0.3 kBT) that is conserved from bacteria to humans. Triplet recognition is strictly dependent on correct Watson-Crick pairing. Rad51, RecA, and Dmc1 can all step over mismatches, but only Dmc1 can stabilize mismatched triplets. This finding provides insight into why eukaryotes have evolved a meiosis-specific recombinase. We propose that canonical Watson-Crick base triplets serve as the fundamental unit of pairing interactions during DNA recombination.

Kinetic analysis by fluorescence resonance energy transfer combined with the study of base substitutions and base mismatches reveals that recognition of homology, helix destabilization, exchange of base pairs, and initiation of strand exchange are integral parts of a rapid, concerted mechanism in which A:T base pairs play a critical role. Exchange of base pairs is essential for recognition of homology, and physical evidence indicates that such an exchange occurs early enough to mediate recognition.},

Using stopped-flow fluorescence we monitored strand exchange catalyzed by E. coli RecA protein, measuring simultaneously the rate of exchange of A:T base pairs and the rates of formation and dissociation of the three-stranded intermediates called synaptic complexes. The rate of exchange of A:T base pairs was indistinguishable from the rate of formation of synaptic complexes, whereas the rate of displacement of a single strand from complexes was five to ten times slower. This physical evidence shows that a subset of bases exchanges at a rate that is fast enough to account for recognition of homology. Together, several studies suggest that a mechanism governed by the dynamic structure of DNA and catalyzed by diverse enzymes underlies both recognition of homology and initiation of strand exchange.},

Initially, the protein forms a filament with the incoming single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bound in site I. The RecA–ssDNA filament then binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in site II. Non-homologous dsDNA rapidly unbinds, whereas homologous dsDNA undergoes strand exchange yielding heteroduplex dsDNA in site I and the leftover outgoing strand in site II. We show that applying force to the ends of the complementary strand significantly retards strand exchange, whereas applying the same force to the outgoing strand does not. We also show that crystallographically determined binding site locations require an intermediate structure in addition to the initial and final structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the characteristic dsDNA extension rates due to strand exchange and free RecA binding are the same, suggesting that relocation of the complementary strand from its position in the intermediate structure to its position in the final structure limits both rates. Finally, we propose that homology recognition is governed by transitions to and from the intermediate structure, where the transitions depend on differential extension in the dsDNA. This differential extension drives strand exchange forward for homologs and increases the free energy penalty for strand exchange of non-homologs.},

We find that the filament's secondary DNA-binding site interacts with~a single strand of the incoming double-stranded DNA during homology sampling.

It mediates assembly of Rad51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is complexed with replication protein A (RPA); the resulting nucleoprotein filament pairs with homologous dsDNA to form joint molecules. Rad52 also catalyzes the annealing of complementary strands of ssDNA, even when they are complexed with RPA. Both Rad51 and Rad52 can be envisioned to promote “second-end capture,” a step that pairs the ssDNA generated by processing of the second end of a DSB to the joint molecule formed by invasion of the target dsDNA by the first processed end. Here, we show that Rad52 promotes annealing of complementary ssDNA that is complexed with RPA to the displaced strand of a joint molecule, to form a complement-stabilized joint molecule. RecO, a prokaryotic homolog of Rad52, cannot form complement-stabilized joint molecules with RPA–ssDNA complexes, nor can Rad52 promote second-end capture when the ssDNA is bound with either human RPA or the prokaryotic ssDNA-binding protein, SSB, indicating a species-specific process. We conclude that Rad52 participates in second-end capture by annealing a resected DNA break, complexed with RPA, to the joint molecule product of single-end invasion event. These studies support a role for Rad52-promoted annealing in the formation of Holliday junctions in DSB repair.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossover formation requires the stabilization of early recombination intermediates by a set of proteins and occurs within the environment of the chromosome axis, a structure important for the regulation of meiotic recombination events. The molecular mechanisms underlying and connecting crossover recombination and axis localization are elusive. Here, we identified the ZZS (Zip2–Zip4–Spo16) complex, required for crossover formation, which carries two distinct activities: one provided by Zip4, which acts as hub through physical interactions with components of the chromosome axis and the crossover machinery, and the other carried by Zip2 and Spo16, which preferentially bind branched DNA molecules in vitro. We found that Zip2 and Spo16 share structural similarities to the structure-specific XPF–ERCC1 nuclease, although it lacks endonuclease activity. The XPF domain of Zip2 is required for crossover formation, suggesting that, together with Spo16, it has a noncatalytic DNA recognition function. Our results suggest that the ZZS complex shepherds recombination intermediates toward crossovers as a dynamic structural module that connects recombination events to the chromosome axis. The identification of the ZZS complex improves our understanding of the various activities required for crossover implementation and is likely applicable to other organisms, including mammals.},

  abstract = {Accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis depends on the ability of meiotic cells to promote reciprocal exchanges between parental DNA strands, known as crossovers (COs). For most organisms, including budding yeast and other fungi, mammals, nematodes, and plants, the major CO pathway depends on ZMM proteins, a set of molecular actors specifically devoted to recognize and stabilize CO-specific DNA intermediates that are formed during homologous recombination. The progressive implementation of ZMM-dependent COs takes place within the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that polymerizes between homologs and participates in close homolog juxtaposition during prophase I of meiosis. While SC polymerization starts from ZMM-bound sites and ZMM proteins are required for SC polymerization in budding yeast and the fungus Sordaria, other organisms differ in their requirement for ZMM in SC elongation. This review provides an overview of ZMM functions and discusses their collaborative tasks for CO formation and SC assembly, based on recent findings and on a comparison of different model organisms.},

The pathway in eukaryotes consists of the DNA-binding components, which are the homologs of the bacterial MutS protein (MSH 2–6), and the MutL homologs, which bind to the MutS homologs and are essential for the repair process. Three of the six homologs of MutS that function in these processes, Msh2, Msh3 and Msh6, are involved in the mismatch repair of mutations, frameshifts and replication errors2,3, and two others, Msh4 and Msh5, have specific roles in meiosis4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

To assess the role of Mlh3 in mammalian meiosis, we have generated and characterized Mlh3−/− mice15. Here we show that Mlh3−/− mice are viable but sterile. Mlh3 is required for Mlh1 binding to meiotic chromosomes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes from the mid pachynema stage of prophase I. Mlh3−/− spermatocytes reach metaphase before succumbing to apoptosis, but oocytes fail to complete meiosis I after fertilization.

To analyze another product of meiotic recombination, interhomolog noncrossovers (NCOs), we performed high-resolution mapping of recombination events at an intensely active mouse hot spot in F1 hybrids derived from inbred mouse strains. We provide direct evidence that the vast majority of repair events are interhomolog NCOs, consistent with models in which frequent interhomolog interactions promote accurate chromosome pairing. NCOs peaked at the center of the hot spot but were also broadly distributed throughout. In some hybrid strains, localized zones within the hot spot were highly refractory to COs and showed elevated frequency of coconversion of adjacent polymorphisms in NCOs, raising the possibility of double-strand gap repair. Transmission distortion was observed in one hybrid, with NCOs providing a significant contribution. Thus, NCO recombination events play a substantial role in mammalian meiosis and genome evolution.},

  abstract = {During meiotic prophase I, double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate homologous recombination leading to non-crossovers (NCOs) and crossovers (COs). In mouse, 10\% of DSBs are designated to become COs, primarily through a pathway dependent on the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (MutLγ). Mlh3 contains an endonuclease domain that is critical for resolving COs in yeast. We generated a mouse (Mlh3DN/DN) harboring a mutation within this conserved domain that is predicted to generate a protein that is catalytically inert. Mlh3DN/DN males, like fully null Mlh3-/- males, have no spermatozoa and are infertile, yet spermatocytes have grossly normal DSBs and synapsis events in early prophase I. Unlike Mlh3-/- males, mutation of the endonuclease domain within MLH3 permits normal loading and frequency of MutLγ in pachynema. However, key DSB repair factors (RAD51) and mediators of CO pathway choice (BLM helicase) persist into pachynema in Mlh3DN/DN males, indicating a temporal delay in repair events and revealing a mechanism by which alternative DSB repair pathways may be selected. While Mlh3DN/DN spermatocytes retain only 22\% of wildtype chiasmata counts, this frequency is greater than observed in Mlh3-/- males (10\%), suggesting that the allele may permit partial endonuclease activity, or that other pathways can generate COs from these MutLγ-defined repair intermediates in Mlh3DN/DN males. Double mutant mice homozygous for the Mlh3DN/DN and Mus81-/- mutations show losses in chiasmata close to those observed in Mlh3-/- males, indicating that the MUS81-EME1-regulated crossover pathway can only partially account for the increased residual chiasmata in Mlh3DN/DN spermatocytes. Our data demonstrate that mouse spermatocytes bearing the MLH1-MLH3DN/DN complex display the proper loading of factors essential for CO resolution (MutSγ, CDK2, HEI10, MutLγ). Despite these functions, mice bearing the Mlh3DN/DN allele show defects in the repair of meiotic recombination intermediates and a loss of most chiasmata.},

Here we show that the budding yeast mismatch repair related MutLβ complex, Mlh1-Mlh2, specifically interacts with the conserved meiotic Mer3 helicase, which recruits it to recombination hotspots, independently of mismatch recognition. This recruitment is essential to limit gene conversion tract lengths genome-wide, without affecting crossover formation. Contrary to expectations, Mer3 helicase activity, proposed to extend the displacement loop (D-loop) recombination intermediate, does not influence the length of gene conversion events, revealing non-catalytical roles of Mer3. In addition, both purified Mer3 and MutLβ preferentially recognize D-loops, providing a mechanism for limiting gene conversion in vivo. These findings show that MutLβ is an integral part of a new regulatory step of meiotic recombination, which has implications to prevent rapid allele fixation and hotspot erosion in populations., DOI:

The mutL homolog MLH1 is required for nuclear mismatch repair. Previously, cytological analysis of MLH1-deficient mice has implied a role for Mlh1 in crossing-over during meiosis. Here we demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae diploids containing a deletion of MLH1 have reduced crossing-over in addition to a deficiency in the repair of mismatched DNA during meiosis. Absence of either of the meiosis-specific mutS homologs Msh4 or Msh5 results in a similar reduction in crossing-over. Analysis of an mlh1 msh4 double mutant suggests that both genes act in the same pathway to promote crossing-over. All genetic markers analyzed in mlh1 mutants display elevated frequencies of non-Mendelian segregation. Most of these events are postmeiotic segregations that represent unrepaired heteroduplex. These data suggest that either restorational repair is frequent or heteroduplex tracts are shorter in wild-type cells. Comparison of mlh1 segregation data with that of pms1, msh2, msh3, and msh6 mutants show that the ability to promote crossing-over is unique to MLH1. Taken together these observations indicate that both crossing-over and gene conversion require MutS and MutL functions and that Mlh1 represents an overlap between these two pathways. Models of Mlh1 function are discussed.},

These invasion intermediates are converted into double Holliday junctions and then resolved into crossovers that facilitate homolog segregation during Meiosis I. Work in yeast suggests that Msh4-Msh5 stabilizes invasion intermediates and double Holliday junctions, which are resolved into crossovers in steps requiring Sgs1 helicase, Exo1, and a putative endonuclease activity encoded by the DNA mismatch repair factor Mlh1-Mlh3. We purified Mlh1-Mlh3 and showed that it is a metal-dependent and Msh2-Msh3-stimulated endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled DNA.

The meiotic function of Mlh3 is fully dependent on the integrity of a putative nuclease motif DQHAX2EX4E, inferring that the anticipated nuclease activity of Mlh1-Mlh3 is involved in the processing of joint molecules to generate crossover recombination products. Although a vast body of genetic and cell biological data regarding Mlh1-Mlh3 is available, mechanistic insights into its function have been lacking due to the unavailability of the recombinant protein complex. Here we expressed the yeast Mlh1-Mlh3 heterodimer and purified it into near homogeneity. We show that recombinant MutLγ is a nuclease that nicks double-stranded DNA. We demonstrate that MutLγ binds DNA with a high affinity and shows a marked preference for Holliday junctions. We also expressed the human MLH1-MLH3 complex and show that preferential binding to Holliday junctions is a conserved capacity of eukaryotic MutLγ complexes. Specific DNA recognition has never been observed with any other eukaryotic MutL homologue. MutLγ thus represents a new paradigm for the function of the eukaryotic MutL protein family. We provide insights into the mode of Holliday junction recognition and show that Mlh1-Mlh3 prefers to bind the open unstacked Holliday junction form. This further supports the model where MutLγ is part of a complex acting on joint molecules to generate crossovers in meiosis.},

  abstract = {At the final step of homologous recombination, Holliday Junction-containing joint molecules (JMs) are resolved to form crossover or noncrossover products. The enzymes responsible for JM resolution in vivo remain uncertain, but three distinct endonucleases capable of resolving JMs in vitro have been identified: Mus81-Mms4(EME1), Slx1–Slx4(BTBD12) and Yen1(GEN1). Using physical monitoring of recombination during budding yeast meiosis, we show that all three endonucleases are capable of promoting JM resolution in vivo. However, in mms4 slx4 yen1 triple mutants, JM resolution and crossing-over occur efficiently. Paradoxically, crossing-over in this background is strongly dependent on the Blooms helicase ortholog, Sgs1, a component of a well-characterized anti-crossover activity. Sgs1-dependent crossing-over, but not JM resolution per se, also requires XPG-family nuclease, Exo1, and the MutLγ complex, Mlh1–Mlh3. Thus, Sgs1, Exo1 and MutLγ together define a previously undescribed meiotic JM resolution pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in budding yeast and, by inference, in mammals.},

Mammalian MUS81 has been implicated in maintenance of genomic stability in somatic cells; however, little is known about its role during meiosis. Mus81-deficient mice were originally reported as being viable and fertile, with normal meiotic progression; however, a more detailed examination of meiotic progression in Mus81-null animals and WT controls reveals significant meiotic defects in the mutants. These include smaller testis size, a depletion of mature epididymal sperm, significantly upregulated accumulation of MLH1 on chromosomes from pachytene meiocytes in an interference-independent fashion, and a subset of meiotic DSBs that fail to be repaired. Interestingly, chiasmata numbers in spermatocytes from Mus81−/− animals are normal, suggesting additional integrated mechanisms controlling the two distinct crossover pathways. This study is the first in-depth analysis of meiotic progression in Mus81-nullizygous mice, and our results implicate the MUS81 pathway as a regulator of crossover frequency and placement in mammals.},

Furthermore, we show that it is present as numerous foci on the chromosome axes and the synaptonemal complex central element until pachytene. Then, from pachytene to diakinesis, HEI10 is retained at a limited number of sites that correspond to class I COs, where it co-localises with MLH1. Assuming that HEI10 early staining represents an early selection of recombination intermediates to be channelled into the ZMM pathway, HEI10 would therefore draw a continuity between early chosen recombination intermediates and final class I COs.},

  abstract = {Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis requires that homologous chromosomes associate and recombine. Chiasmata, the cytological manifestation of recombination, provide the physical link that holds the homologs together as a pair, facilitating their orientation on the spindle at meiosis I. Formation of most crossover (CO) events requires the assistance of a group of proteins collectively known as ZMM. HFM1/Mer3 is in this group of proteins and is required for normal progression of homologous recombination and proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes in a number of model organisms. Our work is the first study in mammals showing the in vivo function of mouse HFM1. Cytological observations suggest that initial steps of recombination are largely normal in a majority of Hfm1−/− spermatocytes. Intermediate and late stages of recombination appear aberrant, as chromosomal localization of MSH4 is altered and formation of MLH1foci is drastically reduced. In agreement, chiasma formation is reduced, and cells arrest with subsequent apoptosis at diakinesis. Our results indicate that deletion of Hfm1 leads to the elimination of a major fraction but not all COs. Formation of chromosome axial elements and homologous pairing is apparently normal, and Hfm1−/− spermatocytes progress to the end of prophase I without apparent developmental delay or apoptosis. However, synapsis is altered with components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex frequently failing to extend the full length of the chromosome axes. We propose that initial steps of recombination are sufficient to support homology recognition, pairing, and initial chromosome synapsis and that HFM1 is required to form normal numbers of COs and to complete synapsis.},

Although Slx1 is a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes, no orthologs of Slx4 were reported other than in fungi. Here we report the identification of Slx4 orthologs in metazoa, including fly MUS312, essential for meiotic recombination, and human BTBD12, an ATM/ATR checkpoint kinase substrate. Human SLX1-SLX4 displays robust Holliday junction resolvase activity in addition to 5′ flap endonuclease activity. Depletion of SLX1 and SLX4 results in 53BP1 foci accumulation and H2AX phosphorylation as well as cellular hypersensitivity to MMS. Furthermore, we show that SLX4 binds the XPFERCC4 and MUS81 subunits of the XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-EME1 endonucleases and is required for DNA interstrand crosslink repair.

The first step is resection by helicases and nucleases to produce single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that defines the homologous locus. The ssDNA is a scaffold for assembly of the RecA/RAD51 filament, which promotes the homology search. On finding homology, the nucleoprotein filament catalyzes exchange of DNA strands to form a joint molecule. Recombination is controlled by regulating the fate of both RecA/RAD51 filaments and DNA pairing intermediates.

Second-end capture products were not detected when polη was replaced by other polymerases such as polδ or polι. RAD52 could not be replaced by RAD51.

Meiotic crossovers are essential for ensuring correct chromosome segregation as well as for creating new combinations of alleles for natural selection to take place. During meiosis, excess meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated; a subset of these breaks are repaired to form crossovers, whereas the remainder are repaired as non-crossovers. What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale – in addition to current models for the generation of interference – is also included. This Commentary aims to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the factors that promote or prevent meiotic crossing over.},

  abstract = {In the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination, the DNA break ends must first be processed into 3′ single-strand DNA overhangs. In budding yeast, end processing requires the helicase Sgs1 (BLM in humans), the nuclease/helicase Dna2, Top3-Rmi1, and replication protein A (RPA). Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Sgs1-dependent end processing in real-time. We show that Sgs1 is recruited to DNA ends through Top3-Rmi1–dependent or –independent means, and in both cases Sgs1 is maintained in an immoble state at the DNA ends. Importantly, the addition of Dna2 triggers processive Sgs1 translocation, but DNA resection only occurs when RPA is also present. We also demonstrate that the Sgs1–Dna2–Top3-Rmi1–RPA ensemble can efficiently disrupt nucleosomes, and that Sgs1 itself possesses nucleosome remodeling activity. Together, these results shed light on the regulatory interplay among conserved protein factors that mediate the nucleolytic processing of DNA ends in preparation for homologous recombination-mediated chromosome damage repair.},

  abstract = {The topoisomerase III (Top3)-Rmi1 heterodimer, which catalyzes DNA single strand passage, forms a conserved complex with the Bloom's helicase (BLM, Sgs1 in budding yeast). This complex has been proposed to regulate recombination by disassembling double-Holliday junctions in a process called dissolution. Top3-Rmi1 has been suggested to act at the end of this process, resolving hemicatenanes produced by earlier BLM/Sgs1 activity. We here show that, to the contrary, Top3-Rmi1 acts in all meiotic recombination functions previously associated with Sgs1, most notably as an early recombination intermediate chaperone, promoting regulated crossover and noncrossover recombination, and preventing aberrant recombination intermediate accumulation. In addition, we show that Top3-Rmi1 has important Sgs1-independent functions that ensure complete recombination intermediate resolution and chromosome segregation. These findings indicate that Top3-Rmi1 activity is important throughout recombination, to resolve strand crossings that would otherwise impede progression through both early steps of pathway choice and late steps of intermediate resolution.},

Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate meiotic recombination. We identify ANKRD31 as a key component of complexes of DSB-promoting proteins that assemble on meiotic chromosome axes. Genome-wide, ANKRD31 deficiency causes delayed recombination initiation. In addition, loss of ANKRD31 alters DSB distribution because of reduced selectivity for sites that normally attract DSBs. Strikingly, ANKRD31 deficiency also abolishes uniquely high rates of recombination that normally characterize pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of X and Y chromosomes. Consequently, sex chromosomes do not form crossovers, leading to chromosome segregation failure in ANKRD31-deficient spermatocytes. These defects co-occur with a genome-wide delay in assembling DSB-promoting proteins on autosome axes and loss~of a specialized PAR-axis domain that is highly enriched for DSB-promoting proteins in wild type. Thus, we propose a model for spatiotemporal patterning of recombination by ANKRD31-dependent control of axis-associated DSB-promoting proteins.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved Spo11 protein. Studies in yeast have shown that DSB formation requires several other proteins, the role and conservation of which remain unknown. Here we show that two of these Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, Mei4 and Rec114, are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotes. Mei4−/− mice are deficient in meiotic DSB formation, thus showing the functional conservation of Mei4 in mice. Cytological analyses reveal that, in mice, MEI4 is localized in discrete foci on the axes of meiotic chromosomes that do not overlap with DMC1 and RPA foci. We thus propose that MEI4 acts as a structural component of the DSB machinery that ensures meiotic DSB formation on chromosome axes. We show that mouse MEI4 and REC114 proteins interact directly, and we identify conserved motifs as required for this interaction. Finally, the unexpected, concomitant absence of Mei4 and Rec114, as well as of Mnd1, Hop2, and Dmc1, in some eukaryotic species (particularly Neurospora crassa, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) suggests the existence of Mei4–Rec114-dependent and Mei4–Rec114-independent mechanisms for DSB formation, and a functional relationship between the chromosome axis and DSB formation.},

Several other proteins are essential for meiotic DSB formation, including three evolutionarily conserved proteins first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mer2, Mei4, and Rec114). These three S. cerevisiae proteins and their mouse orthologs (IHO1, MEI4, and REC114) co-localize on the axes of meiotic chromosomes, and mouse IHO1 and MEI4 are essential for meiotic DSB formation. Here, we show that mouse Rec114 is required for meiotic DSB formation. Moreover, MEI4 forms a complex with REC114 and IHO1 in mouse spermatocytes, consistent with cytological observations. We then demonstrated in vitro the formation of a stable complex between REC114 C-terminal domain and MEI4 N-terminal domain. We further determine the structure of the REC114 N-terminal domain that revealed similarity with Pleckstrin homology domains. These analyses provide direct insights into the architecture of these essential components of the meiotic DSB machinery.},

DSBs arise concomitantly with the development of axial chromosome structures, where the coalescence of axis sites produces linear arrays of chromatin loops. Recombining DNA sequences map to loops, but are ultimately tethered to the underlying axis. How and when such tethering occurs is currently unclear. Using ChIPchip in yeast, we show that Spo11-accessory proteins Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4 stably interact with chromosome axis sequences, upon phosphorylation of Mer2 by S phase Cdk. This axis tethering requires meiotic axis components (Red1/Hop1) and is modulated in~a domain-specific fashion by cohesin. Loss of Rec114, Mer2, and Mei4 binding correlates with loss of DSBs. Our results strongly suggest that hotspot sequences become tethered to axis sites by the DSB machinery prior to DSB formation.},

They also have delayed and/or fewer recombination sites but, paradoxically, more DSBs, suggesting DSB dysregulation. Unrepaired DSBs and pairing failures—stochastic on autosomes, nearly absolute on X and Y—cause meiotic arrest and sterility in males. Ankrd31-deficient females have reduced oocyte reserves.

Recent studies are starting to reveal critical roles for different protein modifications in regulating SC dynamics. Protein SUMOylation, N-terminal acetylation, and phosphorylation have been shown to be essential for the regulated assembly and disassembly of the SC. Moreover, phosphorylation of specific SC components has been found to link changes in SC dynamics with meiotic recombination. This review highlights the latest findings on how protein modifications regulate SC dynamics and functions.},

Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships.},

In mammals, the DNA binding specificity of PRDM9 determines where DSB occur, whereas in yeast, Spo11 acts in regions which one important feature is chromatin accessibility. However, DSB formation requires additional proteins located on chromosome axes, and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, Spp1 has been recently identified to make the link between axes and DSB sites. These recent findings open exciting routes to understanding how the requirement to regulate DSBs along and between homologs is achieved.},

The meiosis-specific subunits endow the cohesin complex with specific functions for numerous meiosis-associated chromosomal events, such as chromosome axis formation, homologue association, meiotic recombination and centromeric cohesion for sister kinetochore geometry.

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is required for correct segregation of chromosomes to gametes and to generate genetic diversity. In mice and humans, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are initiated by SPO11 at recombination hotspots activated by PRDM9-catalyzed histone modifications on open chromatin. However, the DSB-initiating and repair proteins are associated with a linear proteinaceous scaffold called the chromosome axis, the core of which is composed of cohesin proteins. STAG3 is a stromalin subunit common to all meiosis-specific cohesin complexes. Mutations of meiotic cohesin proteins, especially STAG3, perturb both axis formation and recombination in the mouse, prompting determination of how the processes are mechanistically related. Protein interaction and genetic analyses revealed that PRDM9 interacts with STAG3 and REC8 in cooperative relationships that promote normal levels of meiotic DSBs at recombination hotspots in spermatocytes. The efficacy of the Prdm9-Stag3 genetic interaction in promoting DSB formation depends on PRDM9-mediated histone methyltransferase activity. Moreover, STAG3 deficiency has a major effect on DSB number even in the absence of PRDM9, showing that its role is not restricted to canonical PRDM9-activated hotspots. STAG3 and REC8 promote axis localization of the DSB-promoting proteins HORMAD1, IHO1, and MEI4, as well as SPO11 activity. These results establish that PRDM9 and axis-associated cohesin complexes together coordinate and facilitate meiotic recombination by recruiting key proteins for initiation of DSBs, thereby associating activated hotspots with DSB-initiating complexes on the axis.},

Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases are the major players in these processes. Disruption of meiosis-specific HOP2 or MND1 genes leads to severe defects in homologous synapsis and an early-stage recombination failure resulting in sterility. Here we show that mouse Hop2 can efficiently form D-loops, the first recombination intermediates, but this activity is abrogated upon association with Mnd1. Furthermore, the Hop2–Mnd1 heterodimer physically interacts with Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases and stimulates their activity up to 35-fold. Our data reveal an interplay among Hop2, Mnd1 and Rad51 and Dmc1 in the formation of the first recombination intermediates during meiosis.},

Here, we report that mouse Morc2b encodes a functional germ cell-specific member of the MORC protein family. Morc2b arose specifically in the rodent lineage through retrotransposition of Morc2a during evolution. Inactivation of Morc2b leads to meiotic arrest and sterility in both sexes. Morc2b-deficient spermatocytes and oocytes exhibit failures in chromosomal synapsis, blockades in meiotic recombination, and increased apoptosis. Loss of MORC2B causes mis-regulated expression of meiosis-specific genes. Furthermore, we find that MORC2B interacts with MORC2A, its sequence paralogue. Our results demonstrate that Morc2b, a relatively recent gene, has evolved an essential role in meiosis and fertility., In sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis, a process unique to germ cells, produces haploid gametes. Abnormalities in meiosis can lead to infertility, loss of pregnancy, or genetic diseases such as Down syndrome. The meiotic processes are tightly regulated by a large number of genes including many meiosis-specific ones. The majority of meiosis-specific factors are conserved, however, species-specific factors have evolved. Here we report functional studies of a rodent lineage–specific gene named Morc2b. Morc2b belongs to a family of chromatin-remodelling factors. Morc2b is specifically expressed in germ cells. Disruption of Morc2b causes meiotic arrest and infertility in both sexes. Notably, MORC2B regulates the expression of a number of meiosis-specific genes. Interestingly, MORC2B interacts with its sequence homologue MORC2A. These functional studies have uncovered a new protein complex in the regulation of key meiotic processes and suggested the presence of continued selection pressure for evolution of new meiosis-specific factors.},

In budding yeast, three ZMM (Zip1/2/3/4, Mer3, Msh4/5) proteins, Zip2, Zip4, and Spo16, form a “ZZS” complex, functioning to promote meiotic recombination via a DSB repair pathway. Here, we identified the mammalian ortholog of Spo16, termed SPO16, which interacts with the mammalian ortholog of Zip2 (SHOC1/MZIP2), and whose functions are evolutionarily conserved to promote the formation of COs. SPO16 localizes to the recombination nodules, as SHOC1 and TEX11 do. SPO16 is required for stabilization of SHOC1 and proper localization of other ZMM proteins. The DSBs formed in SPO16-deleted meiocytes were repaired without COs formation, although synapsis is less affected. Therefore, formation of SPO16-SHOC1 complex–associated recombination intermediates is a key step facilitating meiotic recombination that produces COs from yeast to mammals.},

  abstract = {The BLM helicase has been shown to maintain genome stability by preventing accumulation of aberrant recombination intermediates. We show here that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLM ortholog, Sgs1, plays an integral role in normal meiotic recombination, beyond its documented activity limiting aberrant recombination intermediates. In wild type meiosis, temporally and mechanistically distinct pathways produce crossover and noncrossover recombinants. Crossovers form late in meiosis I prophase, by polo kinase-triggered resolution of Holliday junction (HJ) intermediates. Noncrossovers form earlier, via processes that do not involve stable HJ intermediates. In contrast, sgs1 mutants abolish early noncrossover formation. Instead, both noncrossovers and crossovers form by late HJ intermediate resolution, using an alternate pathway requiring the overlapping activities of Mus81-Mms4, Yen1, and Slx1–Slx4, nucleases with minor roles in wild-type meiosis. We conclude that Sgs1 is a primary regulator of recombination pathway choice during meiosis, and suggest a similar function in the mitotic cell cycle.},

In meiotic recombination, multiple repair pathways are used to repair meiotic DSBs, and current studies suggest that BLM may regulate the use of these pathways. Based on literature from S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans, we present a unified model for a critical meiotic role of BLM and its orthologs. In this model, BLM and its orthologs utilize helicase activity to regulate the use of various pathways in meiotic recombination by continuously disassembling recombination intermediates. This unwinding activity provides the meiotic program with a steady pool of early recombination substrates, increasing the probability for a DSB to be processed by the appropriate pathway. As a result of BLM activity, crossovers are properly placed throughout the genome, promoting proper chromosomal disjunction at the end of meiosis. This unified model can be used to further refine the complex role of BLM and its orthologs in meiotic recombination., 
, In meiotic recombination, Blm utilizes its helicase activity to disassemble early recombination intermediates, thereby retaining a pool of recombination sites from which some can be selected to enter the Class I crossover pathway while simultaneously promoting SDSA and preventing the use of the Class II pathway.},

In addition, recombination and replication are inextricably linked, as recombination recovers stalled and broken replication forks, enabling the evolution of larger genomes/replicons. Defects in recombination lead to genomic instability and elevated cancer predisposition, demonstrating a clear cellular need for recombination. However, recombination can also lead to genome rearrangements. Unrestrained recombination causes undesired endpoints (translocation, deletion, inversion) and the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates. Evidently, HR must be carefully regulated to match specific cellular needs. Here, we review the factors and mechanistic stages of recombination that are subject to regulation and suggest that recombination achieves flexibility and robustness by proceeding through metastable, reversible intermediates.},

  abstract = {Recombination in meiosis is a fascinating case study for the coordination of chromosomal duplication, repair, and segregation with each other and with progression through a cell-division cycle. Meiotic recombination initiates with formation of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at many places across the genome. DSBs are important for successful meiosis but are also dangerous lesions that can mutate or kill, so cells ensure that DSBs are made only at the right times, places, and amounts. This review examines the complex web of pathways that accomplish this control. We explore how chromosome breakage is integrated with meiotic progression and how feedback mechanisms spatially pattern DSB formation and make it homeostatic, robust, and error correcting. Common regulatory themes recur in different organisms or in different contexts in the same organism. We review this evolutionary and mechanistic conservation but also highlight where control modules have diverged. The framework that emerges helps explain how meiotic chromosomes behave as a self-organizing system.},

Multiple recombination pathways with specific intermediates are expected to lead to COs and NCOs. We revisited the mechanisms of meiotic DSB repair and the regulation of CO formation, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of strand-transfer intermediates associated with recombination events. We performed this analysis in a SK1 × S288C Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid lacking the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Msh2, to allow efficient detection of heteroduplex DNAs (hDNAs). First, we observed that the anti-recombinogenic activity of MMR is responsible for a 20\% drop in CO number, suggesting that in MMR–proficient cells some DSBs are repaired using the sister chromatid as a template when polymorphisms are present. Second, we observed that a large fraction of NCOs were associated with trans–hDNA tracts constrained to a single chromatid. This unexpected finding is compatible with dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) during repair, and it suggests the existence of a novel control point for CO formation at the level of the dHJ intermediate, in addition to the previously described control point before the dHJ formation step. Finally, we observed that COs are associated with complex hDNA patterns, confirming that the canonical double-strand break repair model is not sufficient to explain the formation of most COs. We propose that multiple factors contribute to the complexity of recombination intermediates. These factors include repair of nicks and double-stranded gaps, template switches between non-sister and sister chromatids, and HJ branch migration. Finally, the good correlation between the strand transfer properties observed in the absence of and in the presence of Msh2 suggests that the intermediates detected in the absence of Msh2 reflect normal intermediates.},

              Motivation
              The development of high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies now allows the investigation of the population diversity of cellular transcriptomes. The expression dynamics (gene-to-gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly expressed genes. In addition, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same genes at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent a summarized view of single-cell expression data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a most powerful tool for high dimensional data representation, by searching for latent directions catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distance and projections that poorly work in presence of over-dispersed count data with dropout events like single-cell expression data.
            
            
              Results
              We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. It is able to jointly build a low dimensional representation of cells and genes. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data visualization, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes. Our method is competed against other standard representation methods like t-SNE, and we illustrate its performance for the representation of single-cell expression data.

  abstract = {A series of microarray experiments produces observations of differential expression for thousands of genes across multiple conditions. It is often not clear whether a set of experiments are measuring fundamentally different gene expression states or are measuring similar states created through different mechanisms. It is useful, therefore, to define a core set of independent features for the expression states that allow them to be compared directly. Principal components analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique for determining the key variables in a multidimensional data set that explain the differences in the observations, and can be used to simplify the analysis and visualization of multidimensional data sets. We show that application of PCA to expression data (where the experimental conditions are the variables, and the gene expression measurements are the observations) allows us to summarize the ways in which gene responses vary under different conditions. Examination of the components also provides insight into the underlying factors that are measured in the experiments. We applied PCA to the publicly released yeast sporulation data set (Chu et al. 1998). In that work, 7 different measurements of gene expression were made over time. PCA on the time-points suggests that much of the observed variability in the experiment can be summarized in just 2 components--i.e. 2 variables capture most of the information. These components appear to represent (1) overall induction level and (2) change in induction level over time. We also examined the clusters proposed in the original paper, and show how they are manifested in principal component space.

  abstract = {Homing in on Hotspots
The clustering of recombination in the genome, around locations known as hotspots, is associated with specific DNA motifs. Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by Cheung et al.). Parvanov et al. (p. 835, published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas Myers et al. (p. 876, published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome. Baudat et al. (p. 836, published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species.
Meiotic recombination events cluster into narrow segments of the genome, defined as hotspots. Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome.

  abstract = {Although strict asexuality is supposed to be an evolutionary dead end, morphological, cytogenetic, and genomic data suggest that bdelloid rotifers, a clade of microscopic animals, have persisted and diversified for more than 60 Myr in an ameiotic fashion. Moreover, the genome of bdelloids of the genus Adineta comprises 8\%–10\% of genes of putative non-metazoan origin, indicating that horizontal gene transfers are frequent within this group and suggesting that this mechanism may also promote genetic exchanges among bdelloids as well. To test this hypothesis, we used five independent sequence markers to study the genetic diversity of 576 Adineta vaga individuals from a park in Belgium. Haplowebs and GMYC analyses revealed the existence of six species among our sampled A.~vaga individuals, with strong evidence of both intra- and interspecific recombination. Comparison of genomic regions of three allele-sharing individuals further revealed signatures of genetic exchanges scattered among regions evolving asexually. Our findings suggest that bdelloids evolve asexually but exchange DNA horizontally both within and between species.},

  abstract = {Recombination between homologous, but non-allelic, stretches of DNA such as gene families, segmental duplications and repeat elements is an important source of mutation. In humans, recent studies have identified short DNA motifs that both determine the location of 40 per cent of meiotic cross-over hotspots and are significantly enriched at the breakpoints of recurrent non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) syndromes. Unexpectedly, the most highly penetrant form of the motif occurs on the background of an inactive repeat element family (THE1 elements) and the motif also has strong recombinogenic activity on currently active element families including Alu and LINE2 elements. Analysis of genetic variation among members of these repeat families indicates an important role for NAHR in their evolution. Given the potential for double-strand breaks within repeat DNA to cause pathological rearrangement, the association between repeats and hotspots is surprising. Here we consider possible explanations for why selection acting against NAHR has not eliminated hotspots from repeat DNA including mechanistic constraints, possible benefits to repeat DNA from recruiting hotspots and rapid evolution of the recombination machinery. I suggest that rapid evolution of hotspot motifs may, surprisingly, tend to favour sequences present in repeat DNA and outline the data required to differentiate between hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Insights into the origins of structural variation and the mutational mechanisms underlying genomic disorders would be greatly improved by a genomewide map of hotspots of nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Moreover, our understanding of sequence variation within the duplicated sequences that are substrates for NAHR lags far behind that of sequence variation within the single-copy portion of the genome. Perhaps the best-characterized NAHR hotspot lies within the 24-kb-long Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)–repeats (REPs) that sponsor deletions and duplications that cause peripheral neuropathies. We investigated structural and sequence diversity within the CMT1A-REPs, both within and between species. We discovered a high frequency of retroelement insertions, accelerated sequence evolution after duplication, extensive paralogous gene conversion, and a greater than twofold enrichment of SNPs in humans relative to the genome average. We identified an allelic recombination hotspot underlying the known NAHR hotspot, which suggests that the two processes are intimately related. Finally, we used our data to develop a novel method for inferring the location of an NAHR hotspot from sequence variation within segmental duplications and applied it to identify a putative NAHR hotspot within the LCR22 repeats that sponsor velocardiofacial syndrome deletions. We propose that a large-scale project to map sequence variation within segmental duplications would reveal a wealth of novel chromosomal-rearrangement hotspots.},

  abstract = {Several large-scale studies of human genetic variation have provided insights into processes such as recombination that have shaped human diversity. However, regions such as low-copy repeats (LCRs) have proven difficult to characterize, hindering efforts to understand the processes operating in these regions. We present a detailed study of genetic variation and underlying recombination processes in two copies of an LCR (NF1REPa and NF1REPc) on chromosome 17 involved in the generation of NF1 microdeletions and in a third copy (REP19) on chromosome 19 from which the others originated over 6.7 million years ago. We find evidence for shared hotspots of recombination among the LCRs. REP19 seems to contain hotspots in the same place as the nonallelic recombination hotspots in NF1REPa and NF1REPc. This apparent conservation of patterns of recombination hotspots in moderately diverged paralogous regions contrasts with recent evidence that these patterns are not conserved in less-diverged orthologous regions of chimpanzees.},
